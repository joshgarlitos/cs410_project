what a fantastic place to have a drink or two, you can have a meal in the Three Broomsticks.or do what we do just sit back and Enjoy the view of hogwarts castle.fantastic place to visit any time of the year. steve sue dave uk.
The ribs were good portion but too fatty for my taste. Seems the restaurant was a bit disorganised. My husband enjoyed the sheppard pie, its served in tin foil plate. Plastic tools. Busy place. Pickup and find your table... Chairs too low for the table we sat at. There is better places around the park.
We just went there for the hot butterbeer. Even though it was busy there were plenty of registers so it went fairly fast. Felt sort of odd buying only butterbeer there when people were getting huge meals but watcha goin to do....drink more butterbeer of course!
We traveled to Universal and The Wizarding World of Harry Potter with my wife and two sons (ages 13 and 16). Lunch at the Three Broomsticks was part of our overall Harry Potter “experience” while at Islands of Adventure. Overall, it was a great experience, and I’d recommend it. We were there on a Wednesday, and my tip is to get there early! We arrived at 11AM and got right in, but by noon, there was a very long wait. We ordered Fish and Chips, Rotisserie Smoked Chicken Platter and kids mac and cheese along with a thanksgiving meal for my wife. The food was good, but for us. The décor and atmosphere were on point and in keeping with theme and vibe of other Harry Potter spots in the park. Of course they offer Butter Beer.Highly recommend.
The food was mostly great, however the portions seemed small, and one dish was a bit undercooked. The price is high for what you get, but I suppose that is the Mitch of tourism?
We had an early dinner/late lunch at Three Broomsticks during our visit to Islands of Adventure. We stopped in earlier to try some Butterbeer and pumpkin juice from the Boar's Head in the back, then returned for some food after the lunch crowds had somewhat dispersed. We shared the Chicken and Ribs Platter with some more Butterbeer. The food was not too bad, and the platter was big enough to share between two people. The prices not too bad considering the portion size and the fact that it is in a theme park. It can get very busy because of its popularity, but if you go during off times you should be able to find a place to sit with little problem. The restaurant looked like an old hunting tavern with antlers on the walls and wagon wheel candlelights, and made you feel like you were on set of the Harry Potter movies. This is a definite must-go for fans of the movies.
The Three Broomsticks is always a nice place to visit at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. If you choose to sit outside,and especially if you go during off times, it's usually a nice little spot away from the bustling crowds, enjoying a nice ale before you head back out to ride the Forbidden Journey. The prices are decent as far as the parks go, I had the Fire Cider and my husband had the Hogs Head Brew, both very good choices. As far as food goes, the menu is nothing remarkable especially for what you might get elsewhere in the park (bland pub food in my opinion). So sit out the food, just go for a drink!
Go early before the crowds and enjoy. Lovely options and a delightful English Breakfast vegetarian! Wonderful ambiance!
For theme park food, Three Broomsticks, is very good. Hearty servings, tastes good. Kids options as well. Lots of fun. 
It was ok but quite expensive for what we got , also a bit cold,,not much choice and paying too much because it’s harry potter 
As Potter heads we had to eat here for lunch. It isn't cheap but the food is real and good. We had the feast which came with roasted chicken, ribs, corn, potatoes and vegetables. The food was quite good and he atmosphere great.
It was a dream since I ever read Harry Potter in childhood to drink pumpkin juice in Three Broomsticks and it came true when I visited this place in Universal. The ambience is wonderful and mesmerising. I felt as if I was actually sitting in a wizarding world. The food is a little expensive but great to taste. The special Pumpkin juice is amazing. Loved everything about it.
"Our reservation and travel voucher made this an easy place to experience. If you are familiar with the books, then this restaurant fits the description of the place very specifically. We ate by the large fire place and had a wonderful ""Olde English Breakfast"""
Really cool ambiente. Great in detail. 3 Broomsticks and Hog's Head are basically in 1 building, with each having an entrance. We went for an early lunch at 11am. It was busy but not crowded. When we got ready to leave around 11:45 it started to get packed. Everything is quite expensive. The chicken was good. Just very expensive. A beer is 8.99!
Stopped in for a quick lunch and it was. The line was fast moving and it was easy to order. Fish and chips was spot, Beef Pasties were filling, but the best part was the Apple Pie!!
Traveling from the UK with a charity that gives poorly children the holiday of a lifetime. 12 children, 12 helpers and 4 admin visited here for lunch and with the professional help and hospitality of Lexi it made lasting memories for this very special group of people. Food, service and atmosphere are second to none. Thank you Three Broomsticks and LEXI!! 
We had a fun dinner at the Three Broomsticks! Frozen butter beer and fish and chips! The fish was delicious! Seating was limited due to its popularity, but, not impossible. The staff was very friendly and patient. So glad we did not stop at the kiosks!
After a long walk, there's nothing more revival than a delicious meal at the Three Broomsticks. I'll surely come back!!
Love the theming here. Remember no regular beverages are available. We didn’t see the side order options on the way in so didn’t really order what we would have liked but never mind. Food was relatively plain and one dish cold, but the service here was excellent (unlike the Leaky Cauldron visited the day before). The theming is good but it is so busy that you can’t really take in your surroundings. Despite a number of tables available in nice areas next to fire, in main dining area, we were disappointed again to be shoved round the back on a table where we couldn’t fit our kids in as the people on the next table, being of size, were practically sitting on their seats too. We asked politely if we could just take one of the many other available tables not so crammed in, in a better area, but the guy insisted we sit where he said and then even moved the table and chairs so that the kids could sit down. People right behind us were sat in the areas we would have preferred to sit so I don’t know why we got so unlucky. Really disappointing and even for a huge HP fan wouldn’t bother to go back, it was not a good experience. 
This was a quick service meal which is located by the Harry Potter attractions. It was busy but the line moves pretty fast. Once in line, you pass by a large window which showcases all the entree choices. I ordered the shepherd's pie which was quite tasty with a nice flaky crust. My favorite part of the meal was the butterbeer ice cream. It was absolutely scrumptious and a large serving, too.
Good place, food is OK. They have fast service. We ordered Beef pasties, Shepherd's Pie, and Butterbeer. The 2 entree came with a salad. They were tasty and reasonably priced.I also had the frozen butterbeer. The foam is the best part! I think they changed the recipe from the last time I had it (which was maybe 3 years ago!), it tastes slightly better now, though very sweet. If you are watching your calories - do not order butterbeer! ;-P
I ate here for lunch and there wasn't that many other people around. The woman that took my order was very hard to understand and didn't seem sure of what she was doing. My friend wanted to get the Hot Butterbeer and the cashier kept trying to get him to order something else. She probably did this because it was hot but after verifying what he wanted she should of just dropped the questioning. We both used the Dining plan and because I had the refill mug i couldn't get a drink with my meal nor could I get a refill for my mug, so I got tap water instead. It didn't take too long to receive the food and there was plenty of places to sit. The atmosphere of the place was great. There was tons of details in place just in one room of the restaurant. I got the chicken and ribs platter which looked good but was anything but. Both the chicken and ribs were very dry. I only ate about half of the food and ended up throwing most of it out. My friend liked his Shepard's Pie so maybe that would be better but I definitely wouldn't get the chicken and ribs again.
Visited on 30 oct havent never eaten here before we were sent directly to cash desk not having seen a menu so we stood back try to decide wat to eat cashiers did not like this .. we then decided to order cashier was the rudest young man i have ever witnessed did not want to be doing his job. We ordered my daughter asked for pancake breakfast he goes “ no pancakes” this was 11.30 we presumed she could still have them so i ordered her kids fish chip he charged us adult and to be honest we werent going to argue with him as he was so rude. I asked for beer no beer all he said so older lady cashier beside him coped his attitude and she goes u can order beer over there at bar if u wish. Well tk u mam someone with bit manners.Anyhow food was awful really awful dont waste ur money very disappointed 
Order at the counter, carry your own meal to tables. Portions are generous and tasty. Relatively quiet. Back patio is probably the quietest location in entire park. Universal Dining Card includes their meals. Frozen Butter Beer is great snack, but beware of brain freeze. Generally faster service for regular butter beer than standing in line at wagon outside.
Just to say you are at the Three Broom Sticks!! It's cool to see Potter fans of all ages, sizes and colors in their robes and wands having lunch.... the line was about a 10 minute wait to order your food, 5 minutes to get your food and beverage (this is where customers need direction as where to head for the tables), 3 minutes in a waiting area for a table... not bad amount of fans having lunch. The food is plenty, I diffenatly could have shared!!
Loved my reuben sandwich with more butter beer., And looking at the inside of this place is awesome! All the upper walkways, the staircases and balconies, and the barmaids who told us all about the upper rooms where young witches live after Hogwarts. WOW>
Baked Chicken, roasted potatoes, ribs, and corn on the cob, yes please! This food was great and you will not be disappointed! 
The theming was really good but the food was not great . We had fish and chips and chicken with roasted potatoes. It was just all a bit tasteless. 
Eating lunch at the Three Broomsticks was fun and helped with the feel of being transported to the Harry Potter world.
Nice lunch with the family. Lots of food -good tasting - pricey but expected because of being in an amusement park. Counter service - would have been nicer if they delivered food to table after ordering— manipulating a tray with 3 meals on it difficult. Chairs at table were too low for adults to sit and eat comfortably.
We got the family platter for 4 and added one extra person, it had chicken, ribs, potatoes, vegetable, and corn. Perfect amount of food and price was great. It did take a little while for the food to come out. It is considered a fast food area. Love the Decor. 
It's the setting that people are there for I am assuming, and not the food or service. It felt more like a fast food place than table service, however they do bring you your food at the table after ordering it in line and paying for it before being served, much like McDonalds. I had the fish and chips and they were average, Captain D's is better lol. However, the setting is pretty amazing and while I am not a big Harry Potter fan, my family is and they loved how the place looked. They agreed, the food was average at best.
This is not fast food like burgers and pizza. You will get a quality meal here. There is plenty of English style food here. You can also get alcohol and butter beer! I had the ribs and chicken platter and it was good. Plenty of food and cooked with plenty of seasoning. My only issue with this restaurant is you have to find your own seating and Universal unlimited refill cups can’t be used here. 
Believe me. U just returned from London, and the fish and chips platter is better here than in there. The meat, presentation, and the amount of food is better.
My friends like to go here every time we go to Universal. It’s not my favorite place. The food tastes okay, but it’s generic Americanized British food. I would highly recommend their fish and chips but other than that it’s not that special. 
"The meal I got was absolutely delicious! In theme parks you get a lot of ""quick"" foods that either aren't healthy or hearty, and this was both! The atmosphere inside was incredible, just how you would imagine it would be. Soft HP themed music played, with the sounds of people in the pub.THE ONLY CON I HAVE IS THERE WAS NO BUTTERBEER SERVED IN THE RESTAURANT. There really should be since The Three Broomsticks is where butterbeer originated from the books."
The food here was edible, but that’s about all I could say for it. Be aware that they do not serve sodas here. The atmosphere was probably the best part of this place 
Worth eating here - not a bargain, as nothing in the theme parks will be. But a fun atmosphere that's very faithful to the books, generous portions of well-prepared chicken or turkey, corn and potatoes. I usually eat veggie, so I was limited to soup and salad. (Would a vegetable pot pie be too much to ask..?) It's attached to the Hog's Head pub, with it's animatronic Hog, which is cute. Friendly staff, as you'll find all through 'Hogsmeade'. 
I ate here for the first time about 2 weeks ago and it did not disappoint! As a vegetarian, I usually opt for snacks throughout the park but my friends were hungry and this was their spot. They don't have it on their menu but you can ask the cashier for the vegetarian platter which consists of 3 sides of your choice. I had the mac n cheese, potatoes, and salad. Everything was cooked to perfection and it was very filling! Will definitely be back here if I'm hungry and at the park.
Prices were reasonable. Great service. We were served quickly which allowed us to go back to the park quickly. Food was abundant and very good! Service was very fast.
This place had more options for our child who has a peanut allergy. Way more. We ate here most of the time.Corn on the cob was good as was the kids chicken legs/turkey leg. Fish and chips were fine but nothing special. The Hogshead beer was good. They gave us discount refills for our butterbeer souvenir mugs so that was cool.Overall we were very happy with this establishment on our 3 day stays. Theming was perfect also.
Food was average. Workers not as friendly as the workers outside the restaurant. Had a fast food restaurant feel.
The food here is abundant, as another reviewer said. The flavor is good and the price reasonable. The service is good as well but the best is the place, really exceeded my expectations on the decoration and architecture of the place.
We always make this part of our trip to Islands of Adventure. The atmosphere is so authentic and transports you into the world of the Harry Potter books. The food is surprisingly good and a pretty good value, as they are quite large and easily shared. Many of us had the fish and chips, which are 3 big pieces of breaded cod and thick fries. They were very good but not as crisp this time. Some were a bit soggy. Some of our party enjoyed the chicken platter including the granddaughter who is celiac. They accommodated her needs very well. Don’t forget to try the frozen butterbeer! So good and refreshing
This was our 3rd time sting at three broomsticks. It’s so tasty. Great fish and chips. The details in this restaraunt are so great. Everywhere you look there are awesome things.It’s a little pricey but so worth it.
I found the food that I purchased very unsatisfying. The salad tasted like it came out of a bag and the beef pasties were too salty and did not taste like beef. I shared one with my son, who loves meat, and he thought they tasted more like a vegetarian mix or some strange meat. I wanted to try something different, so I ordered the beef pasties, but I would not recommend them to anyone. They were very disappointing. There are many wonderful places to eat at Universal, but I would not recommend this setting. They benches were uncomfortable and the lighting was not good for a rainy day. It is a self-serve restaurant, where you order and pick up. My advice...go somewhere else. I paid too much for something that ended up in the trash!
The three broomsticks was awesome!! We went for dinner and then for breakfast the next morning. The dinner meal was a little crowded but lines moved fast. The breakfast was quiet and had fast service. I am gluten free and this was one of the few gluten free specific restaurants that had good food! The sweet tea was awesome and my kids loved the pear juice. The decor was so cool too. I really felt like I was in Hogsmeade! Definitely check it out!
This restaurant serves English food which tastes nothing like English food. I had fish and chips the batter on the fish is sweet similar to pancake better. The chips were nice. When you are sitting in here it’s just like the dinner hall in the film. Staff are friendly and helpful. Don’t forget to pick up your broomsticks and wand on the way out.
Fantastic food, great portions. Staff were fab.If your choosing where to go then go here as the Leaky cauldron was shocking. Three broomsticks was really lovely food and worth the wait in the cues.Look at the corn on the cob ! Says it all 
Atmosphere was great as was the service- food wasn’t the best but you pay for the atmosphere....my daughter loved it!!!
The theme is nice but the food was only fair to avg and typical for fast service at the parks. Nice that they help find seats but next time walk outside of Harry Potter World and go to other less crowded places.
We ate here around 1pm. We had to wait to get in. Wait for food. Wait to sit with our food. The food was ok. The restaurant was warm inside. Was a bit disappointed. FYI they do not serve soda inside. The pumpkin drink is a definite PASS The host was nice. The food prep folks not so much. 
This would have been fine if we had not been to the Leaky Caldron the day before. The portions were smaller, the choices not as tasty, and the prices every bit as expensive. It was ok if you remember it is park food, but we've had better.
Husband. Myself. 3 “kids” 22,22 and 21. First visit years back was breakfast. This was early dinner at 4. Not too crowded but their ordering system needs work. Very congested area and confusing when picking up food. Ordered fish n chips. Excellent. And the feast for 4, for$59. Was well worth it and had food left over. Delicious chicken, ribs, 4 full corn on cob, potatoes/broccoli/carrot/onion medley was good. Salad for 4. Was plenty for at least 6 people and well under what you’d pay if did per person. Gilly water is a $4 bottle of water. Don’t bother. Left full. 
The Three Broomsticks is not my favorite of the two Harry Potter restaurants but its still pretty good. The atmosphere is quaint. You will feel like you are in the movie. I highly recommend the dining plan. Anyone can buy it, regardless of where you are staying. Its affordable, around $27. It works in Harry Potter world and most of the park. The Three Broomsticks is eligible as the quick-service meal, so you can experience the English-inspired cuisine for a decently affordable price. Our party had the Chicken Dinner and the Shepherd's Pie. The rotisserie style chicken was good as were the sides of potatoes and corn on the cob. The Shepherd's pie was a bit bland and need some salt and pepper.
We stopped in while touring the Hogsmeade area of the park for more pub fare and a Harry Potter experience. I had the Shepherd's Pie and my son had Fish and Chips. Both meals were tasty and certainly very filling. We liked it so much, we went back a second time.
First of all let me say that, The Three Broomsticks does not take reservations. You might think, as packed as Universal can be, it will be impossible to get a table there without reservations! Not necessarily! When we went in late May, we went to The Three Broomsticks around 2 pm. We had to wait in a line to get in but the line moved at a good pace. When you get to the end of the line, you are directed to go up the next available open counter (they have several). There, your order is taken & you pay for the meal. After that, you stand in another line to get your food. It is a very streamlined process. There were plenty of seats available so thankfully, that wasn't an issue. My husband, my daughter & I ordered the rotisserie smoked chicken platter which came with a half smoked chicken, corn on the cob & roasted potatoes. It was delicious! My son is a picky eater. He absolutely loves macaroni and cheese though so he ate that. He ate half of it but he said he liked it. They have other items on their kids menu as well. I would definitely go back there if we ever go back to Universal.Just FYI...They offer the rotisserie smoked chicken platter for four for $49.99 which will save almost $2 than buying the platters individually.
We visited in mid-July, with three small children (ages 7, 5 and 2). The food was very tasty. Portions were a bit small for the price, but that was to be expected. The restaurant was very crowded, which was also to be expected. We arrived just before the lunch rush, and by the time we finished, there was only outdoor seating available. I recommend eating an early lunch there if you can.
We had this restaurant included in a park/hotel package.It was clean and staff friendly and efficient. Food tasted good, nothing morePortions were OK, but portions were better at the leaky Cauldron in Universal Studios Daigon Alley. The atmosphere here is dark and brooding and kid of fits the motif of the park area! But the HP area itself is more inviting than here. I would def try this once if you haven't already or if you are a HP fan!
It was only my 16 yr old and I but we got a platter that had ribs and chicken and it was fantastic. We shared it because I wasn't very hungry but it ws so good!
It has a good theme with Harry Potter but the food was average and over priced for the quality. It is British themed food. We did not have a wait. Order at the counter, pick up your food and then find a table. 
My family and I made our second visit to three broomsticks. We were pleased with the food, we’ve gotten breakfast both times. We also enjoy the atmosphere and the staff are polite, professional and in character. All in all it was a great breakfast experience, for adults and children alike.
We visited the Three Broomsticks for a dinner and chose the platter for 4 which includes a salad bowl then platter with ribs, chicken, potatoes, corn on the cob & vegetables. Even although we were eating quite late, after 2130 it was all cooked fresh and was delicious. Would recommend! Staff were also very pleasant and friendly. Worth a visit. 
I really don’t understand how places can serve such an awful English breakfast. Totally expensive & inedible. Sausage were not fried, boiled I think looked awful & tasted same. Beans were not Heinz which is ok but at least try to taste like them. Also you serve a croissant, very British??? 
Just cafeteria food at high-casual prices. Good for a quick lunch if you don’t mind dropping $10 per kid and $20 per adult (with drinks). Don’t make this a destination. Not really vegetarian friendly, not sure why it is listed as such.
I'd rather give this place a 3.5 but with the poor other options in the park this one is better. The only problem is that Universal has 2 main types of food options and this is what is served every where. I liked the roasted chicken. Others in the family liked the salad and the fish and chips.
"Let me start off with saying that if you aren't having the fish and chips, you're doing it wrong. Not to knock the other options, but why wouldn't you want fish and chips? In all reality, this is a great food option within the WWoHP. Especially considering the prices aren't much different than that of the ""park food"" restaurants for higher quality grub. Also, as a Pro tip, sneak through the back of the restaurant (or use the other door) to go to the Hogs Head. The lines are usually shorter there for butterbeer than anywhere else in the park, and as an added bonus it is air conditioned."
This was the best food I have had in a while! At first we just got s plate for me and my daughter to share of salad and Cornish pastries. There were only 3 on the plate, fairly good size, but they were so good we ate them all! My husband and son split the ribs and chicken. It has an entire ear of corn and amazing potatoes! We went back and got another plate of this. We ate every bite! It was only 15.99 good price not only for the amount of food on the plate, but the quality! The ribs literally fell off the bone and the chicken was so good!!! My family wanted to eat it every meal. We have the pickiest eaters too! We walked in and had our food in less than 10 minutes. I would just go eat here if I didn’t have to go to Universal.
"Food and Beverages:We stopped here twice. Early on we had breakfast; pancakes for me and gluten free pancakes for my girlfriend. Mine tasted great and came with delicious bacon (was that redundant?) sausage, and for some inexplicable reason a croissant. Can't have too much starch, I guess. Hers had extra bacon in place of the sausage and croissant and the pancakes were different and looked even better than mine. The only downside was having ""breakfast syrup"" in place of Maple syrup. Our second visit was in late afternoon, after we already had lunch, for Butterbeer. The lunch, at Finnegan's Bar & Grill, was pretty good and is covered in a separate review. However, after seeing people chowing down on the ribs and other entrees we wished we had held out for another meal here.The Butterbeer was delicious. To answer the often-asked question, it does not contain any alcohol. (At $7.50 per 8 oz glass alcohol drinks might be less expensive.) What it is is a blend of cream soda, butterscotch, almond flavoring, and vanilla. It's served icy cold with a thick layer of flavored foam that Universal claims is non-dairy. It is on the very sweet side and you may want to consider sharing one glass between two people and repeating the process if you want more. (You'll probably want more.)Service:It's quick and courteous. My girlfriend has a gluten and dairy allergy and mentioning it at breakfast earned her a visit from the chef who worked out a custom menu that fit her needs. Anyway, you place your order and pay for it, get your beverages from the counter and then take a seat in the colorfully (and intentionally) drab dining area waiting for your food to be delivered. Other Thoughts:I wish this place was accessible without having to pay a park admission and more conveniently located to Northern Virginia so I could eat there more often."
The atmosphere alone is worth it. The food was good. Baked chicken a little greasy, but it was good. They skimp on the sides, especially for the price, but all tasty and would go back. We didn't have pumpkin juice till the last day, I wish we would have tried it sooner, I would have had it more than once. Of course butter beer is amazing. I like frozen better. Over all yum.
I was pleasantly surprised that we were able to walk right up to the cashier without having to wait in line. We ordered the Great Feast. We had more than enough food for the 4 of us and I felt bad about leaving so much uneaten. The Feast included salad, chicken, ribs, corn on the cob and roasted potatoes, onions, carrots and red peppers. The ribs and potatoes were the best part of the meal. We got water to drink, but also got a butter beer to split. The butter beer liquid tasted like cream soda and the froth on top tasted like butterscotch. I’m glad we tried it, but at $7, it was quite pricey. The restaurant looks just like it did in the movies. 
We enjoyed the food but did not enjoy the area we were seated, in the corner by the door behind a column.
If you are a meat-eater, the big platter they offer at lunch is the way to go! If you are a vegetarian/vegan, there are some options that aren't too bad. Much better than the rest of the park itself. Breakfast is the best for your money, where a butter beer is an included drink with your meal. Lines can get long, so you'll want to time them off the peak eating hours. 
Of course we had to eat at Three Broomsticks! The atmosphere was wonderful. Portions were large, but food was a bit greasy. I loved the pumpkin juice!
Found in Universal’s Islands of Adventure - thus was sooooo good, and not just for my Harry Potter loving son and me. We ordered the Great Feast (for 4), with roast chicken, spareribs, corn on the cob, mixed veggies, and salad, as well as a fish and chips meal. All of it was perfectly cooked and more than enough food to feed the five of us. It was probably the best fried fish I’ve ever eaten. The pear cider was a big hit too. 
We stopped at the Three Broomsticks for some dessert in Hogsmeade at Universal’s Islands of Adventure. The service was great and very quick, and our ice cream from Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor as well as the butterbeer was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone in our party. The food and atmosphere here is very similar to that of the Leaky Cauldron restaurant in Diagon Alley in Universal Studios. I recommend Three Broomsticks for a relaxing sit-down meal, dessert, or drink in Hogsmeade at Islands of Adventure. 
We ordered a variety of meals both adult and children's and all was delicious. I appreciate that no soda is served. They have pear cider, apple cider, pumpkin juice; fizzy or flat, This was one of our favorite meals.
I traveled to Universal and The Wizarding World of Harry Potter with my husband and two daughters (ages 13 and 10). Lunch at the Three Broomsticks was part of our overall Harry Potter “experience” while at Islands of Adventure. Overall, it was a great experience, and I’d recommend it. We were there on a Monday, and my tip is to get there early! We arrived at 11AM and got right in, but by noon, there was a very long wait. We ordered Fish and Chips, Rotisserie Smoked Chicken Platter and kids mac and cheese. The food was good, and the air conditioning provided welcome relief from the heat, but for us, it was really more about saying we had been there than anything else. The décor and atmosphere were on point and in keeping with theme and vibe of other Harry Potter spots in the park. Of course they offer Butter Beer, which we also wanted to say we tried. (Tastes like frothy butterscotch in my opinion. Others say cream soda.)We wanted to eat at either the Leaky Cauldron or Three Broomsticks and opted for the latter based on the menu. We were happy with our choice. I’d suggest checking out the menus in advance.
We decided before leaving Ohio that we had to eat at Three broomsticks. We were very impressed at the authenticity of the entire Harry Potter area at both Universal parks. It was like being inside the movie. Three broomsticks had a long line but they were able to move people through it very quickly and efficiently. My husband and I each ordered the Cornish pasties. The dish is served with a salad I asked for corn on the cob as a substitute and it was no problem at all. We both enjoyed our food however the pasties themselves were not very big (about the size of a pierogi or a ravioli) and we only got about four of them each. Not nearly enough food for an adult. The corn on the Cob had lots of “strings” on it. Someone took the time to pull the husk back and tie it neatly at the end which made a nice presentation but they didn’t pull off the strings that then get stuck in your teeth. Very annoying. The kids each ordered chicken fingers that could have been from any restaurant in any city but obviously there were other options. I would recommend this restaurant for the experience but don’t go hungry or you may end up leaving hungry as well. Prices are reasonable. I would have paid more for a bit more to eat.
Cashier service was a bit slow, but food was prepared quickly. Chicken was moist and tasty, ribs were flavorful. Entrees come with potatoes and corn. Staff seat you after you pick up your food. No Coca Cola refill station in restaurant, you can use your dining meal voucher at this location. Entrees are between $12-$16
It was cool to actually eat here because the inside looks a lot like it does on the movie, but the food was just O.k. Small portions and high prices. My husband got the fish and chips which was o.k. The meat filled pie things are something i definitely won't get again. Left there broke and hungry!
We had fish and chips, the fish was quite good but they gave us the bare minimum of fries which made this expensive for a 4 pieces of fish and 10 fries. Bottled water is also expensive because it’s labelled “Gilly”, if you leave Harry Potter world the water is $1.50 cheaper and the bottles are bigger
Really lovely food. Portion sizes were good. Although was surprised we couldn’t do refill in our refillable cup. Don’t like the idea we have to get food first then sit down, should be able to find a seat first then order. As good was going cold. Although did find nice seat under shade outside over looking castle. Bins were overflowing outside though which isn’t to pleasant. 
Excellent time for dinner at Three Broomsticks. Ordered the feast for 6. Lots of food for a fair price. Don't forget the wet naps!
I especially enjoy the Cornish pasties, and my son liked the Shepherd’s pie. The seating is a little odd...the chairs are too short for the tables.
We ate here once for breakfast and once for supper. Very generous with portions and food was really good. Employees were amazing.
This place is awesome. Not only is the decor so fun to look at but my husband and I ate breakfast here (no reservation) and it was delicious. You can make reservations but we hadn't and waited no longer then those that had them. I was nervous about the food selections as I am VERY picky and everything they have is kinda british themed (for obvious reasons) but the breakfast selections were a-plenty and I got the Oatmeal dish with fresh fruit and LOVED it. My husband got the traditional english breakfast and he loved his as well. It is a little pricey for breakfast but you do get alot of food. We left full and re-energized for the rest of our time at the park! Highly recommend for breakfast.
The food was good but nothing particularly special. However, the atmosphere was excellent! We went around 11:30a and didn’t encounter any waiting. It was a fun lunch!
I had Ice tea and Sheperd's Pie for lunch. Service was excellent ( Cafeteria style) and the portions were perfect! 
We got butter beer and walked through the restaurant to see the atmosphere. Then we sat out back in a private outside eating area which has a view of the castle. 
The place was great to sit and look around feeling you are in the books of Harry Potter. We did not do the advanced reservations but the wait was 30 minutes at lunchtime prime. Grab you a butter beer at cart in front of restaurant to wait in line. Nice, comfy table to relax. I had the meat pies that were very tasty and not too seasoned. The classic fish and chips were exactly what it says. The Ribs/ Chicken Platter is a big meal for the hungry person. Good food for the experience and worth the wait.
It's ok, the food was hot, the room was air conditioned, what you want in a park. Also, very nice decorations
We ate here for lunch, arriving around 11:30. Quickly got in. Quickly ordered our food. Quickly received our food. Two orders of fish and chips, one order of chicken salad, one butterbeer, and kids chicken legs meal. All delicious! Hot! Fresh tasting! Beautiful decor truly out of the Harry Potter films!
We really loved the atmosphere of this restaurant, and the great food choices. This is a must do for anyone visiting Universal Orlando.
The food was good, but the main attraction here is the staff. When we were ordering, we asked the cashier if the macaroni was Kraft or homemade. He responded with, I don't know what Kraft is! It was confusing at first, but I believe he was staying in character...Anyway, the decor inside is wonderful and overall it really feels like you're in Harry's world.
Stopped in the 3 Broomsticks after visiting with Potter and the crew at Hogwarts. My wife had fish and chips and the fish was hot and the batter was crispy. I had the Shepherds Pie and it was fabulous, and my salad delicious. My standards at a theme park are pretty low but this was quite good regardless of location. Not cheap but certainly good. No soda but water and cider as well as Butterbeer which I dislike greatly.
Great food, plenty to keep you full. Prices a little high and drinks were extra even with the platter but, that is expected. No complaints with the amount or taste of food. Our whole platter was gluten free and celiac safe. 
I thought the Three Broomsticks was a very good value for a theme park meal. I got the the chicken and rib platter and it was very good!! I thought the potatoes were excellent! The portion sizes were acceptable and for the price, you really can’t go wrong!! My only complaint is the lack of soda in the restaurant (as is the case with the entire HP world at Universal so not their fault). I enjoyed the meal so much I ate there two days in a row!
We ate here while visiting Hogsmeade in Harry Potter World. The food was good. I would recommend getting the Feast. It was priced right with lots of food and it tasted great!!
The Three Broomsticks is a restaurant in the Harry Potter series, and it was very cool to see this brought to life in Universal Studios. When we got to the place, there was a very long lineup, because there were loads of people who wanted the experience.When we got to the front of the line, the cashier was a kind woman, and she got our orders in very quickly, gave us a table and we sat waiting for our food. We expected the food to take a long time to get to the table, considering how busy it was, but the wait was only 10 to 15 minutes, which was great, because my family and I were very hungry after a long morning of walking around the park.The food was very good and I thought that it would be great to come back here in the future.The decor in the restaurant was amazing, and stayed very true to the Harry Potter series.Overall, this was an amazing experience, and even though there was a long wait, it was all worth it in the grand scheme of things.-Kala
Walk up counter service serving English traditions such as shepherds pie, fish and chips and similar. Decent enough though not fantastic - seems a bit like frozen and reheated menu rather than freshly made. Wasn’t terrible by any stretch but wasn’t wonderful either. The ambience is old English Harry Potter - not surprising given the location in Hogsmeade. 
We looked up the reviews for restaurants in Universal studios and this one is rated highly. I love the Harry Potter theme and they are really efficient in seating. When you first come in it’s so busy you might worry if you will have a place to sit when you get your food but they know what they are doing. We didn’t have any delay in getting a table when we were ready to sit down. The menu is not expansive, but the it was true to the theme of the restaurant. I got the fish and chips which were delicious. Nicely seasoned and crispy. The potato wedges were nice and abundant. I added corn which was good and sweet. My sister had the chicken salad that she said was good. I really enjoyed the ambiance of the place and would go back again. 
This restaurant has decent food. They also have butterbeer and you must try that if you are going to this park. Go during non-tradition eating times and you will get seated faster.
"We had breakfast here. Its a semi-self serve restaurant where you order your food and bring it back by tray to a table of your own choosing. We each had the American Breakfast - pricey but it is a theme park. It comes with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage links and potatoes and a choice of beverage. My daughter had the pumpkin juice. Warning - You need to love pumpkin to drink it. The food wasn't terrible. The atmosphere is fantastic. We chose a table next door at the Hogsmeade Inn - there is a HUGE hog's head over the bar. If you order any ""pork"" items, he comes to life and growls at you. All in all, a great experience."
Had lunch and dinner here, more to say we had been rather than for the food. Ordering is slower than it should be and the ambience is nothing special. The food was decidedly average and the fact they don’t serve soda may limit your choices. Overall it was fine but nothing special and the usual Universal price premium. 
Loved this restaurant! We (my husband, myself, kids 13, 11, and 10 at the time) decided to eat breakfast at our hotel and eat light throughout the day and splurge on dinner. This was a good option because not only were we saving money, but no one felt sick in the heat or on rides all day. We did our research and decided we would eat here one night for dinner. We knew not to go at peak times. We chose to go a couple hours before the parks closed so that we had time to walk around, shop, and look at things after we ate. Our family of 5 got the Great Feast, and it was enough for all of us! One of my boys doesn't eat salad, so he ate a bit more meat than the rest of us did. It worked out great! You can add an extra serving if you want, for $14.99. We will probably do that the next time we visit. We had enough food for all of us, but my kids' appetites have increased since then. We are BIG eaters, though, so it may not be necessary for everyone to get the extra serving. We got frozen butterbeer, which is absolutely delicious. The food was hot and delicious! The staff was friendly and very helpful! If you have a problem, just tell them! We didn't have any issues, but they made sure that we had everything we needed. The food is a bit on the expensive side, but you're at a theme park. Of course it's expensive. The portions are very large, and you definitely get what you pay for. We were incredibly satisfied! Can't wait to go back in a year or two!
My teenage daughter has celiac and we ordered the Gluten free pancakes. She was starving and so excited to try it. After a long wait, we received 3 cold and beyond dry silver dollar sized pancakes thrown on a metal pie plate. No accompaniments. All for the bargain price of $18 and change. She couldn’t even eat them. We are accustomed to paying more for GF items but this was the first time we ever felt penalized for her illness. What a ripoff. Shame on Universal ! Last time we will ever visit . Hope things have changed for other guests.
I recommend this place for breakfast and to start your day at the parks and it is a quick service meal if you are on the meal plan so that works for me.
It was a cool atmosphere with the basic breakfast food. Nothing special but the atmosphere and this is what you are basically paying for, so we loved it.
My family and I ate here during spring break. We had to wait in a 15 minute line to place our order. , but the food and frozen butter beer was worth it! Unlike the leaky cauldron you have to find your own seat. It's best to go here during non-peak lunch times(before 12pm) and dinner times(before 3pm or after 6pm).My family and I always order the chicken & ribs platter. We have never been disappointed or ill after eating here. Three platters with three butter beers cost $80. Yes, it's expensive, but expected at a theme park. We'll definitely return!
We always go to the three broom sticks when at universal, you can expect a good meal in a cool atmosphere. I always get the turkey leg, it’s $15 and comes with potato wedges. It is a lot of meat if you are very hungry, it’s a pretty good value. The Frozen butter-beer is the best! (You can get it anywhere in the Harry Potter section) If you don’t want to pay $4.50 for “Gilly Water” just ask for cups of water. Everything is overpriced in universal, but this restaurant at least has good food. 
Very regimented. Which it needs to be due to the vast numbers that go there. I had fish and chips which was very basic and dry. With no mushy peas. My daughter has shepherds pie which was small but adequate. My hubby had half a chicken which he says was fine. The surroundings were nice and authentic . The food could have been fresher. Adequate in the absence of an alternative 
This is a nice sit down restaurant inside the Harry Potter part of Islands of Adventure. They offer rotisserie chicken, turkey legs, soup, salads, and chicken strips for the kids. It was a nice change from burgers and pizza. The system of ordering food before you can be seated is both good and bad. Good because people can’t hold tables long before they have their food, but bad because while you stand with your food waiting to be seated, your food is getting cold. The rotisserie chicken sandwich as delicious and still warm, but my potatoes and corn were quite cold by the yum we sat to eat. Kids chicken tenders, fried, and fruit were good, and my older daughters soup and salad were delicious. I’d say it’s a step above normal park food and would still recommend to anyone in the parks looking for a sit down meal. 
The Menu had typical Harry potter food, typical London fare, and book items like Pumpkin juice and Butter beer.The Three Broomsticks is attached to The Hofs Head where they sell alcohol with I.D. but Three Broomsticks proper did not offer alcohol.
We had breakfast here. It looks so authentic and the service is great! It was the best food I had on my entire vacation! We love this Harry Potter park one and the one in Florida even more (it is bigger)
I had breakfast here - you queue to order and then queue again to pick up food. Staff couldn't be bothered. By the time you sit down,breakfast is cold and tasteless. All served on plastic plates with plastic forks. Yum!
This was our 2nd visit to the Harry Potter areas of Universal. We didn't eat in any of the theme restaurants the first time, but our HP crazy daughter was determined this time, so we let her choose and this was her choice. The lunch line was intimidating long, but it moved quite smoothly and we spent no more than 15-20 minutes in line. The menu was nicely HP/English themed and we ordered a variety; Fish and Chips, Spare-Ribs platter, and Chicken Leg Kids meal. The food was delicious, service pleasant and efficient, and decor warm and pleasant. Prices a little high (but it's a theme park). Our only slightly negative comment would be that drink prices were very high, about $4 for soft drinks. Four soft drinks totaled over 25% of the entire meal cost.
We waited about 30 minutes to be seated. You order at a counter and go to another counter and pick up your trays of food. A worker will seat you quickly after that. Soup and salad: decent. Fish n chips: pretty good. Ribs/chicken/corn: really good. Great atmosphere. Cost us $70 for 5 entrees/no drinks.
It does feel like you are in the movie, but I think the food in the movie was better. We had to wait in line for an hour, which is fine, but it is like a cafeteria. The food was just ok, nothing special, and expensive. Glad to have the experience, but don't plan on eating here again.
The Cornish Pasties were shameful, terrible, awful. Nothing like a real Cornish pasty... no wonder people that English food is awful. Universal has put in ZERO effort to get this right. This is truly a shame as it’s a great idea and a real pasty would be a quick and fitting meal for Hogsmeade.Overall my daughter (7) who is a massive Harry Potter fan said it wasn’t worth the queue.
We stopped here to get lunch. We know meals are done quick at these places but was frustrated when macroni and cheese is cold. Fish and chips... Fish was greasy and breading was thick. For the amount of money they charge, even though it is quick, we expected better. I would not stop here again. 
We were lucky. The crowds were low (at 5:30!) and there were plenty of tables. We had a lovely round table tucked in behind large glass urns and stained glass windows all around us. I loved the low ceilings and the wood throughout. We did the chicken and ribs with potatoes and corn of the cob. It was exactly what we were hoping for (and didn't get at Leaky Cauldron). Most people on here are reviewing after a busy park day experience. Long lines. Waiting for tables etc. This is the unfortunate luck of the draw with the theme parks. We give this the edge over Leaky Cauldron.
We had lunch at the 3 Broomstick. Dont care how they work it, you order your food, pick up your food then wait to be seated... by the time you get to sit and eat the food is cold.. we sat outside because it was quicker so we lost all ambiance in the place
We ate at this restaurant about a year ago and waited about 15 minutes to be seated. This March, we went at a more crowded time and the wait was more like 30 minutes. The queue starts outside and winds around inside past a window display featuring all the entrees served. Then you place your order at the register, then wait for your tray at another window. You are then directed to a table. My husband had the ribs and chicken combo, which is fine, better than most theme park food. I had a salad with rotisserie chicken on top. The chicken was actually very good, and the salad was decent enough, all fresh. They serve packets of Ken's dressing with it. My kids both had the children's chicken finger meals with potatoes. The building itself is very cool both inside and out, and is very authentic looking, save for the food display, food counters and condiment stations. There is also a bar inside the restaurant with cool animated creatures. The prices were fair for theme park food. My salad was $9.99, and it had plenty of chicken on it (all good pieces), not bad at all. Chicken and ribs were $15.99 but ribs are generally expensive anywhere you go. This isn't fine dining but if you want themed dining with decent food, not fast food burger slop, Three Broomsticks hits the mark.
Again, a bit pricey for what you were served. We only ate there for breakfast, the food was a bit on the cool side. I know they were very busy.
We love the Harry Potter Universal experience but the food in the area is aweful. Bad poor selection. Sloppy Management with poorly trained staff. Go to the Sinbad area or back to city walk to eat. Better yet bring a packed lunch. Wingardian Leviosa me to a better restaurant.
out of all the places we did our eating this place was very good. alot of food for the pricing!!!!! staff friendly and the service was fast. must have a pumpkin cider or butter beer...these are a must try !
We found both meals we had at the Three Broomsticks excellent. Didn't go in expecting much beyond ambiance, and came out pleasantly surprised by the food, as well. Definitely go!
My kids loved the atmosphere. The food was only fair, and we waited over 15 minutes in a cafeteria style line after we paid. Lots of staff standing around, seemed to be a holdup in the cooking stations. Seemed odd as there were only 5 choices for breakfast. Bacon and sausage were greasy, eggs were soggy, potatoes weren’t close to done. Hoping we caught them on a bad day. 
Great fish and chips, great full LEGIT English breakfast - mediocre chicken salad lunch. Get in lunch line at 11. Breakfast lines more reasonable. lunch at 12:15 was a 40 minute wait- on a day that was not crowded. the kitchen, cashier, serving lines are not enough to keep that wait reasonable. Food and line and table seating situation all MUCH BETTER at Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley. good English Pub atmosphere. 
"Like The Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley (in Universal Studios Florida), I wasn't impressed with the ""traditional British"" food served in here (such as the Beef Pasties and the Shepherd's Pie), but that is largely due to the fact that I don't care for most British cuisine. The ribs and rotisserie chicken weren't too bad, though both were on the rubbery side and the ribs need more sauce. Prices are high and portion sizes left me hungry. Theming is OUTSTANDING and makes you feel as though you are IN The Wizarding World!!! (I pity them if this is what they have to live on though...you'd think Wizards and Witches could whip up more magically delicious food.) If you are eating with a large group, I recommend getting The Great Feast (which is the Rotisserie Chicken and Spareribs combo with roast potatoes and garden salad for 4 people), as you will save money over buying individual meals. There are very limited salad and soups options for vegans/vegetarians, 4 different meals for kids (even the picky eaters, with dishes like macaroni & cheese, chicken fingers, chicken legs and kid-sized fish and chips), 2 varieties of ""Potter"" draught beers (Hog's Head Brew and Dragon Scale), a few desserts, and of course, NO SODA POP! Coca Cola isn't served in The Wizarding World, so you won't find it here either. Beverage selections include the main 2 versions of Universal's legendary Butterbeer (liquid and frozen), as well as Pumpkin Juice (YUM!), Gillywater (bottled water), Pumpkin Fizz, Lemonade, Iced Tea, and a few other selections.I eat in theme parks every time I go, but it doesn't mean that I necessarily enjoy what I'm eating...I'm just trying to fill the hungry void in my stomach. The food here isn't anything to get excited over, but it IS ever so slightly better than the other slop served at most of Universal's in-park restaurants. It is expensive (you will spend $15-$20 per person, including your drink), and the portions aren't very big (I was still on the hungry side after finishing my meal, drink and dessert). DO NOT feel that you HAVE to eat here...the only real thing you would be missing out on would be the WONDERFUL Potter theming if you eat elsewhere. As it is, it took me 7 years to eat here after it opened...and I realized that I hadn't missed out on anything.Average at best. You'll get a better meal at Mythos in The Lost Continent, or out in CityWalk."
We had a nice and fulfilling breakfast, which was included in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter™ Exclusive Vacation Package.You can also make a booking the day before to secure a spot at the restaurant which is busy in high season.
My husband and I went for breakfast. He bad the American breakfast and I had the pancakes. For $17 a person I expected at least a hot meal. For a quick service spot it wasn't quick at all and it wasn't even busy. The food is clearly already prepared but the people behind the counter are so slow that it took way longer than it should have, hence the cold food. Overall, I wouldn't come here again to eat but the restaurant itself is pretty cool to see.
We had a great lunch in the Harry Potter section of Universal. A quick serve dining experience, the dining room was perfectly themed, the staff quick and attentive and the food was very good! Perfect for lunch!
For the amount they charge for the food you'd think it would be of a better quality. We went for breakfast one day and with the amount of food we ended up getting and how bland it all was made it a less than great meal. The place is well done and does look like how it did in the movies but the food quality was poor.
I gave 2 stars for the great theming, but the food was poor, and expensive for what it was. We were there at 7.30 for supper in February, it wasn't busy, but the floor and many tables were filthy. One person was cleaning tables, but when I went to sit at a clean one, she glared at me - clearly she didn't want to have to clean it again later! My cottage pie was only luke warm, the portions weren't generous. And the low seats made eating uncomfortable for my 6ft 2in husband, never mind the shorter children and I!! Finally, food was cooked and served in plastic pots, with plastic disposable cutlery, it felt like eating a cheap ready-meal out of a microwave. I didn't feel well that evening or the next morning.... Maybe coincidence, but thinking about that meal now makes my stomach turn!!!
Stopped for a bite of lunch and were pleasantly surprised. Shepherds pie, chicken, and ribs were delicious! Wonderful Butter Beer - hot, cold, or iced - it was all FANTASTIC! Loved the help securing our table (by restaurant staff), the food and grog, and the ambiance. I'm a big Harry Potter fan and it was worth the stop here!!
This was a good amusement park meal, not magical, but adequate. The best deal is to get the Feast option which comes with a lot of food and the only real salad on the menu. The butter beer is delicious too!
We got the traditional english and american. The nutmeg and spice in the blood sausage was overwhelming.Other than that the rest of the food was good. The coffee was good as well.
"Really like the way you order your food here, and that an employee finds you a table - this takes away the panic of ""oh no, it's so crowded, I won't find a table!"" and saying to your friend, ""OK, what do you want, you try to find a table for us and sit down, I'll get the food"" - the method here is organized and though yes there's a line for the food, there is no table-finding stress. The food is very good for a quick serve spot - BBQ chicken and ribs, very tasty corn on the cob, good salad, very nice fish and chips. We tried the butterbeer 3 different ways - regular butterbeer, frozen, and butterbeer pot du creme. I found them all to be vile, but the frozen was the least onerous. Butterbeer tastes a bit like creamy butterscotch and a ton of sugar........it's a novelty, you've got to try it, but I wonder how many people honestly like it? The atmosphere in the 3 Broomsticks is very nice, lots of detail in the building that wasn't necessary that makes for a great touch - Universal really went the extra mile here, as they did throughout Harry Potter World. The restaurant is airy and again, look around, look up, lots of fun details."
Was extremely disappointed when visiting Universal with the quality of the food offered. Waited close to 45 minutes before being able to get in to the 3 broomsticks but the actual quality while expensive was better than expected. 
The Three Broomsticks is a counter service restaurant in the Harry Potter section of the park. It has great theming, and the food is good and filling. We had the American Breakfast, Pancake Breakfast, and the Traditional English Breakfast. The last one was unique to us, as it included black pudding, baked beans, grilled tomato, and sautéed mushrooms. Again, it was filling! I recommend The Three Broomsticks, even if it is to just check out the theming.
I was brought back into the books of Harry Potter when I sat down to eat here. They really kept to the atmosphere described. All the chairs were different, they had wonderful rustic decorations and very friendly staff. My mom ordered the fish and chips, which was a large portion and well priced. She says it was delicious. I ordered the pasties. I was a little disappointed by the portion size of mine. I expected at least 4 pasties because they are small but only got 3. It was really good. However, I did receive a salad with mine and it was a nice size and good. I would go back!
My family of four enjoyed dinner at Three Broomsticks during our recent visit to Universal’s Islands of Adventure theme park. As big HP fans, my wife and daughter wanted to experience everything Universal had to offer related to HP, so Three Broomsticks was definitely on the list. Universal does a great job with the details, and Three Broomsticks is no exception. The decor was spot on with the books/movies and everyone loved the atmosphere.As for the food, this is one of the better places to eat inside the park, as it offers non-traditional fares for a reasonable theme park price. My daughter and I each enjoyed a turkey leg and they were tasty and very large - no skimping on the size here. My wife had the chicken and ribs and enjoyed those as well - better than expected for theme park dining. My wife and I also each had a Dragon Scale beer, which was nice and my daughter enjoyed a Butter Beer - a must do for any HP fan. Overall we were pleased with the food and the experience of dining in Three Broomsticks and would certainly visit again the next time we’re at Universal.
"As the title suggests, the food here was just OK. We had the rotisserie chicken, which wasn't bad; it came with corn on the cob (OK) and roasted potatoes, which had that ""steam table"" taste and texture and were hideously overseasoned (rosemary?) But it was better than the usual park fare of burgers, fries, and pizza. The kids had chicken tenders/fries (which she didn't finish because they were ""too peppery"") and mac & cheese/fries. The prices here are in line with other places in the park. The atmosphere/decor was cute, and you could almost picture Slughorn saying ""I can remember when it was One Broomstick!"" The chairs, for whatever reason, are incredibly low in this restaurant (and also mismatched, which added to the cuteness), and you could practically eat your food right off your plate like a dog. The service here was decent, with staff members coming around to take your trays away, and the seating was plentiful. There was also a nice area out back if you want to enjoy the great outdoors. Overall, we decided once was enough and don't feel the need to return. "
We went here for breakfast twice while in Orlando visiting Universal - The first time we were there because we had it included with our hotel and it was decent enough that the second time was our last day there and we realized it accepted our meal plan that we had to use up that day. The second time was not good at all. We were there at 9am - wasn't busy in the parks or the restaurant really and we waited forever for our food. The order was incorrect but we had waited so long we didn't complain for fear of waiting again just as long. All the food was ice cold. It's not cheap ($16.95) for an adult plate which is on paper plates / plastic wear so would hope that it would be at least hot. It's cafeteria style so you order, wait in line, and sit where you see an empty table. Unfortunately it's the only place that we are aware of that you can get an actual breakfast aside from a pastry or breakfast sandwich in the park. First time - ok, second time we would not go back.
We were visiting the Wizarding World of Harry Potter - I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to eat in a HP themed restaurant! The food was standard quick service, with a twist (it was English fare). I enjoyed my meal.
We had to wait a little, they were fairly busy. Once inside we got our dinner fairly quickly. The three of us all had the fish and chips. There was enough food there to feel like we got our money's worth. The quality of the food itself was ok. It was better than I thought it would be. Our usual brush with most theme park food is they skimp on both quality and quantity. My wife had regular butterbeer and my daughter had frozen butterbeer. I tasted both and the taste is the same but the texture is different. I like the frozen butterbeer the best. Butterbeer tastes like vanilla cream soda and they put some type of froth on top. The texture of the froth reminds me of really soft marshmallows but with a cream soda flavor. I opted for the Hogs Meade Beer which reminded me of a Coors Light. There was some flavor but not much body. I prefer strong stouts. Overall, a pleasant experience.
Terrible design for ordering food and picking up!!! Hot in line and it was February! Food was good, but lunch for two adults and one child was $50. I remember why I make reservations at table service restaurants only! 
First visit to Universal Studios and decided on Three Broomsticks for lunch. We went in thinking we'd each get our own thing (think Pub Grub/UK favorites) but saw the Feast for Four and decided on that. Turned out to be a good choice. Decent salad (great on a day when we didn't do much healthy eating) along with some roasted veggies in between the roasted chicken and ribs. Turned out to be plenty for my wife and I and two teenage daughter. Actually had some left. Decent value all things considered. Really liked that the staff guides you to a table. There was a bar at the far end that wasn't crowded at all. You could either head straight there if all you wanted was a drink or re-order from that one mid-meal. Can be a long line at peak times so maybe go early or late.
We ate breakfast here at part of a vacation package and we were not disappointed. I have a picky eater and she was full and happy! We loved the atmosphere and it was very quiet in the morning. 
"This restaurant is considered ""Quick Service"" and does not have reservations. However you are moved through the long lines very quickly. And while it seems slightly chaotic the staff guide you from lines, to orders, to pick up. And even have staff helping you locate seating, with quick cleaning and flipping of tables. Disney could take some tips from the set-up of this quick service restaurant. The adult food option were huge and filling. We ordered the Fish and Chips along with the Ribs and Chicken. Fried white cod and fries. The ribs and chicken had lots of side options - we had corn and potatoes. This filled up my very hungry husband. Our son had the mac and cheese with fries. Not the healthiest option, and the mac and cheese was cold. But that was our only disappointment. The Butterbeer was great. We had one cold and one hot. It tastes a bit like Cream Soda with melted whip cream/vanilla ice cream. A very sweet treat. The hot drink was surprisingly delicious!"
"The line was a little long to get in but it moved quickly. The seating is more intimate than the leaky cauldron. I had the roast chicken, corn on the cob and substituted my potatoes for a salad. Everything was cooked to perfection and was delicious and satisfying. The children had fish and chips and macaroni and cheese with a side of butterbeer (yum!). The restaurant is open to the elements so there were birds flying around. It made it feel more ""wizardy"". The restaurant itself looks exactly as I thought it would when reading the books. I wanted to explore the upper levels! "
If you are looking for a meal that tastes great and won't leave you feeling weighed down the Three Broomsticks is your place! My son is gluten-free and they sent the chef out to discuss our options, which were surprisingly many! He got the rib and chicken platter with the ribs made with no-sauce, but they did provide him a packet. It was amazing! The prices for the meals really aren't that bad. It is the drinks that will cost you. Ask for a cup of ice water. It is free. You can also bring in a refillable water bottle and they have no problem filling it for you. If you are going in for the atmosphere only, you can pop in and order a Pumpkin Fizz or Frozen Butterbeer. Both are amazing!
We ate here thrice, fish and chips, corn on the cob, yum, kids didn't like the butter beer. Easy to get in and out of, lines seem long but they move well.
We came here both for lunch (those turkey legs were awesome), and specifically for breakfast (The Irish/English-style breakfast was a no-brainer!). Both experiences were great. We enjoyed both meals. The turkey legs and other options for lunch were well portioned and had decent flavor....the breakfast was also awesome!! The seating and atmosphere was bit more intimate than it's counter-part in Unviersal, which led to an enjoyable experience. Overall, we enjoyed this as a dining spot!
Walk in, order based on five different selections (butter beer is offered!) wait at a counter for your food and then take your tray to a table. Totally self-service. Nothing special. Restaurant is open to outside and birds were walking/flying around. 
Lines were pretty long to actually sit and eat. But the butter beer was delicious. Not sure if it really had any alcohol or not though.
Our kids were big fans of the family feast with ribs, corn, veggies and chicken.The beer in the souvenir mug was a nice memory to take home as well.
If you're a fan of harry potter, you'll love this restaurant. You can get drinks such as gillywater, pumpkin juice or even fire whiskey. the menu is british inspired. I had a really tasty cottage pie and nice dessert. And they have a good kids menu. It's worth checking out.
Very organized system for waiting in line, ordering food and getting a table. Quality of food is excellent and you can order butter beer or a choice of regular beer. The chicken meal is large enough for two adults to share especially if you order an extra side or two.
"Our family shared the American Breakfast here. It was fine, though I might argue that the eggs were ""fresh"". The warm butterbeer (winter only, I believe) was amazing. We were here mainly for the atmosphere, however. Sitting in this iconic Harry Potter restaurant was a great treat for our family. The Hog's Head bar adjacent to The Three Broomsticks is equally enchanting. We were really happy with the experience, which made up for the mediocre food."
We absolutely love visiting the Three Broomsticks in Orlando, and Hollywood. We were a party of 12 on our most recent trip, and really didn't think we would be able to sit together, but the staff made it work which was amazing!
When you see the line out in front of the restaurant, FYI that is not the entire line. It is also just as long inside too. Just as a heads up that maybe there are less busy times that the line doesn't extend outside? It moved fairly quickly though. And once we ordered the food was out very quickly. They have a good variety of options and different then your normal park food since it is based on Harry Potter so you have a lot of English options like fish and chips and shepherds pie. I got the fish and chips which were really good for park food. My husband got a salad with rotisserie chicken on it which he said was just ok. My son liked his chicken fingers. The atmosphere is cool and you can check out the pub connected to the same dining area. Prices aren't too bad either for the portion and quality of food. I haven't been fond of most of Universal's quick eats type of food but this one was much better. They also seat you so you don't have to go looking around to fight for a table. There is seating outside where you have a great view of Hogwarts too if that interests you! We didn't know it was there until we went to leave.
Well themed, fun restaurant. The food was pretty good, too. The family meal option looked delicious and it was flying out of the kitchen.
The food here has good flavor. It's British themed fare to match the HP parks. Know what you want to order before getting to the counter helps keep the line moving. However, the serve your food where you place your order, in the order that those orders were placed. Then you select your tables. that means, if the person ahead of you ordered something that takes longer, you're still waiting for your food, even if it's ready. We went near the end of the day and ordered the holiday feast (Christmas version of family feast). The person in front of us was delayed waiting for a kids' chicken strips. We got our drinks and salad and finally sat (the family feast gives first course then delivers rest). The food arrived cold. The place doesn't provide carry out containers (we wanted to take back to hotel to reheat and relax). That said, we had eaten here at lunch and were very happy with what we had been served. So our solution was to not eat here close to closing. Other recommendation is to consider the Leaky Cauldron in the other HP park. They take your order and bring your food to your table. Not sure why this restaurant doesn't do things that way, as it would make lines move easier and probably keep food warmer. To be fair, we visited with guest services at the park on the way out and they helped make the situation right. The fish and chips and the fisherman's pie are both very good. Also, prices in this restaurant are very reasonable, particularly for park food. Pricing is comparable to an Applebee's or TGI Fridays.
There were three adults and three children in age 5-7-11. We ordered the platter for 4 for $59.99. It came with a beautifully done roasted chicken quartered, spare ribs (at least a half rack or more), vegetables (broccoli, carrots), four well cooked ears of corn and fried potatoes with onions. There was so much food, we left some chicken, potatoes and vegetables. It was cooked perfectly and a big meal like that for the six of us for $60 was a deal.
Great atmosphere to emerge yourself in Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Great food for a good price. 
This place makes you feel like you are right in the movies. The decor is spot on and the food is really good. The wait can be long but they are great at keeping the line moving and finding seats for everyone. Butterbeer is a must. We had the roasted chicken meal and the beef pasties with salad. Take the time to go here.
The Three Broomsticks really captures the Harry Potter atmosphere! The food is pretty good and filing and the prices aren't too bad. I find Universal dining to be more affordable than Disney! I love themed alcoholic beer and that you can get butter beer with your dinner / lunch! The back patio has nice views of Hogwarts!
Had to wait a while for this, but wanted to sit down and have some decent food. It's pricey (as expected) but our party of 6 all enjoyed their food... the ribs, fish and chips, shepherd's pie end butter beer potted creme were really good!
The food was good but the portions were kinda small. The decor was fun. They directed us to an open table which was helpful.
The interior is very nice and immerses you in the Harry Potter experience. Ordering is simple from a small menu as you wait in line pay then are assigned a window to retrieve your food. Westin is seat yourself and the establishment has exterior seating. The food however is very expensive 3 American breakfast and 2 pancake breakfast with 5 drinks was close to $100, but going to a theme park that is expected. The size of the meal was decent but the bacon is a little under cooked compared to how we like it.
Our family had the Christmas feast of turkey, mushroom stuffing, brussels sprouts, cranberry sauce, parsnips and carrots, with a Christmas pudding afterward. Delicious! Loved the hot butterbeer. The line was long to get in, and I think it would be nice if the restaurant provided menus on their website so plans could be made before reaching the register, but other than that our visit there was quite good. Would recommend it and hope to visit again someday.
We all had a good, big breakast as part of our Harry Potter Universal package. Fresh, good and, though we arrived late, very pleasant, accommodating staff. We came racing in at 10:30 due to a missed shuttle and extra security (for some reason) which was late. The doorman put us right through, breakfast was made fresh and hot, no one was annoyed. Everyone enjoyed their selections and the portions were big.
We stopped in for lunch one day since the line seemed to be moving quickly. There was a good selection of items here, and a good choice of drinks as well. There were good kid-friendly options too. The food was just okay, and it was definitely overpriced, but we were really just there for the atmosphere and experience, which were very neat. The design and decor are over the top. I doubt we'd go back, but I'm glad we tried it.
We had breakfast and dinner here; not lunch. I'm guessing lunch and dinner is same menu. We had no significant wait for either. In fact breakfast was, dare I say, peaceful. It was also a cheaper/more filling option for us than to eat at the hotel. We had the American breakfast. (had the English breakfast the next day at the Leakey Cauldron) Eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes and croissant. For dinner we had fish and chips. Kids plates are much more affordable. For example the kids fish and chips had 2 pieces of fish verses 3 for the adult but was less than 1/2 the price. We ended up spending about as much as the dinner for 4 would have cost us by adding on several specialty drinks. If I had to do it over I would do the dinner for 4 and no specialty drinks, just water and get a much better deal. Have the butter beer, just as a snack. Its so sweet it really is almost a meal of its own. Definitely do the potted butter beer cream. Was like a thick custard and sooo delicious. In my opinion better than the butter beer because it wasn't as sweet, though I did like the butter beer, esp hot; it came at the perfect temp: not too hot and not too cold.Would definitely come here again!
Excellent decor and superbly done chicken and ribs (plus excellent butterbeer icecream) are the upside of this venue. Downside: menu is terribly limited. You can have ribs, chicken, chicken & ribs or the feast. There might also be a salad available. That's it. It also tends to be very crowded, like the rest of the Harry Potter areas.
We were starving and wanted to sit down to a nice meal. The line to enter was out the door but it went fairly quick...took about 25 minutes. You have many opportunities to study the menu along the way and have your decisions ready when you step up to place your order (however, some folks....). After placing your order, you get in another line to pick up your food. We found some lakeside outdoor seating available, We exited the restaurant from the outside by the restrooms and discovered later that you can enter the restaurant from this side entrance and order drinks if that is all you need. It’s quicker than most of the kiosks. We both ordered the Shepherds Pie and it came with a generous salad. Food was satisfying. Butter Beer was great.
the food was good for being a theme park but the service is very welcoming.the outter and inside décor gave great wizardly feels. the restaurant gets filled up quickly, be prepare to wait in line for awhile. order the family feast if in a larger group, chef brings you your meal directly to your table. inside or outside dining available.best part: the side entrance to the bar, a great find!
We ate here during our recent trip. The decor will make you think that you are in a Harry Potter movie. The food was very good and very reasonable. I ordered the Roast Chicken platter = large chicken, herb roasted potatoes, and corn on the cob for $9.99. I also recommend the Butter Beer, a butterscotch flavored cream soda, delicious. The Butter Beer itself is expensive at $7.50 for 8 0z. A frozen version is also available for $10 I believe. I you visit Hogsmeade, a trip to this restaurant is a must. If you travel on a known busy day, plan to eat lunch early (11 .a.m.). 
In the three days at the park, we ate here three times. The ribs are fall off the bone. And you can get a butter beer without standing in the long lines outside. The line to get in may look long, but it goes quickly. This a nice break from the park and good place to sit down and take a breath.
Reservations: not sure why I needed them. It’s simply another long line. Food: breakfast. Limited selections. My wife and daughters did not eat their food. It was a ski resort cafe type quality. Not bad. Drinks: nothing but sugar drinks offered but I guess it doesn’t matter because it’s a small cup with no refills. Quench your thirst prior to arriving. Staff: smiles and pleasant. 
We ate here during our day in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. It's on the Islands of Adventure side in Hogsmede. We were pleasantly surprised as theme park food usually isn't that good. There were six of us and we were there for the Christmas holidays so we got the Holiday Feast. It came with turkey, stuffing, potatoes, sausages, cranberry sauce, gravy, and brussel sprouts.It also came with a salad before the main course. I also got a frozen butterbeer which was very good. Everything was really tasty and for this meal the chef brings it out himself to the table which was neat. It was also very filling and there was more than enough food for everyone. This is a quick service restaurant. You stand in a line and place your order at a register and then wait for it to come up to the counter. Then you take your tray over to be seated in the restaurant. The cashiers were friendly but we thought the guy who seated us was a little rude. Two of us got there ahead of the rest of the party and placed the order for the feast and when they got there the host gave them a hard time about letting them in. I think it was just a misunderstanding, maybe.
My wife and I dined there during our December visit for breakfast. The place was very well done, the lighting perfect for both eating and effects. Though there were several of the UK choices on the menu, we decided to go with the American Cuisine. The ordering, seating and food delivery were very quick and smoothly done.The food was delicious and the portions more than ample. Enough to fill you up without weighing you down.If you are a HP fan, don't miss this place. You can even set a reservation for a specific date and time prior to your arrival. Good food, good times.
We had an amazing meal here. They were able to accommodate all 3 of my allergy kids seamlessly. Unfortunately my boys were less than impressed with the turkey legs, they found them impossible to eat - but there are lots of other options on the menu - even for a gluten/casein free child. I ordered the ribs & they were very good, I highly recommend them. We knew we were eating there, so we got the Universal Dining Plan for the day & ended up saving a little money. And the restaurant itself was amazing - we felt just like we were in the Three Broomsticks in Hogsmead. All in all, an amazing experience. 
Don't look for Coke here; all of the cuisine is tailored to Rowling's idea of British Wizardry culture. The fish and chips are very good, though, and good sized portions.
We wanted to eat in Hogsmeade so we chose Three Broomsticks. It was a little crowded, about 20 minute wait, but not too bad. The atmosphere is great, straight out of Harry Potter! The food is pretty good and not really any more expensive than other park restaurants. Definitely recommend eating here if you want to have dinner in Hogsmeade.
We reserved for 3 persons at 10am. When we got there, we were told to stand in the 15 minute line to get in, in order to place our order. After placing our order, we had to wait in another line for 20 minutes to get our food! No one helped us find a table - we wandered with our trays...Lastly, the bacon was limp, white, and uncooked - had to take it back for replacement. If you are staying on the property and want a better Harry Potter-themed breakfast with an actual reserved time, go to the Leaky Cauldron. I WILL say that I enjoyed the decor at Three Broomsticks.
The service sadly was so unbelievably bad in this place, it really almost entirely ruined our experience. The guy who took or order was slow, never made eye contact, was clearly unhappy to be there and really couldn’t have cared less. Then we waited for our order... and it wasn’t even that busy... we waited and waited and waited, and eventually... my 1 coffee appeared. I kid you not. And the person that served that should not be in the service industry. Two other staff were clearly gossiping about something in the back (which at least they seemed interested about, and chatty with each other!). On the plus side, my coffee was hot. Thank god when we excited, we strolled by the bartender at the back - WHO WAS AWESOME and FRIENDLY and chatting with customers! I think his name was Cornelius. We really wanted to come back and have a drink at the bar - he was so super fun and the bar looks amazing, with the hogs head that moves! Sadly we couldn’t in the end, and I didn’t quite feel right ordering a beer that early... so we missed our hangout time with that rocking bartender!Sniff sniff.
"The food here was good and the atmosphere and decor were perfect, spot on from the movies. What we did like was the ""system"" they had in this place. Unlike Disney, you wait in a monitored line and they tell you what register to go to, which coordinates to a window to pick up your food. Once you get it, you wait for a minute or two while a host finds you a table. That's the difference. You're not standing there with a tray in your hand, craning your neck searching for a place to fit your family. They do it for you, and how refreshing was that?Loved the Butterbeer, too."
Excited that I could go and get some great veggie side items as a meal while my family enjoyed adding meat to theirs. Food was very well done and we enjoyed the atmosphere. 
It wasn't too crowded when we went and we both liked our meals. Ribs were particularly good. We also sampled some beer, which I wish came in a smaller size but most importantly I had my first taste of hot butterbeer here. I was not disappointed and started looking at recipes online to recreate at home. There is indoor and outdoor seating to choose from and you order at one counter and pick up your food at another. it really has a great atmosphere just like you're in the movies.
Kind of a brutish style menu, acceptable prices for being in the park. Our meals were good, service was great and authentic Harry Potter experience.
Ate here for breakfast and wasn’t disappointed. There are a few options to pick from so no a la carte ordering. My wife had the American Continental breakfast and I had the English version (because when in Rome). Potatoes were very good and the croissant were great. Eggs were pretty good too. Sausages were fine. The English one was super unique and nothing like I’ve had before. Fun to try once but I’ll stick to usual kind. We both loved the pumpkin juice. More like a pumpkin apple cider. Other notes: no waiters. You order at a counter and take to one of the many tables. The decorations are really cool and looks very authentic to the films. Fun to try. I made a reservation when I booked my trip. Don’t think it’s necessary for breakfast. In fact, I think the prepaid amount was a tad more than the actual value of the meal. Oh well.  
Food was ok. It really does make you feel like your in the Harry Potter film. Portions were small for price thought. 
The food here is average, but it's all about the atmosphere and butter beer. Service was quick and friendly and not expensive. Happy I went, but one visit is enough. 
Dined here - had the ribs & chicken combo. Food was fine, but nothing special. Atmosphere was good, but not great. Don't see what the fuss was about and not a great value.
Group of six - food ok and service below average. Cattle herding experience. Many better choices on City Walk with better prices! Plastic table service. 
My daughter in law is a HUGE Harry Potter Fan and wanted to eat here. Menus were provided while we waited in line to order which was nice. Menu is small but varied. We ordered and each of us wanted bottled water. Food is brought to the table. When we saw the tiny sizes of the water bottles we were really disappointed because the only way to get more was to get back in that rather long line. Our server was kind enough to bring us glasses of tap water but next time I will know to get 2 bottles per person!! I had the Scotch Egg. When I ordered I asked if it was an appetizer or a meal and the person taking the order said I could do it either way. So I ordered the meal; my son ordered it as an appetizer. When the food came, I just go a double portion of the appetizer--no sides or anything!!! But my daughter in law was so happy to eat here and I thought the place was fun so I would return again, knowing that I will get 2 bottles of water and a real meal!!!!
Best part were the potatoes! We had this and the Leaky Caldron for breakfast as part of the Harry Potter package. Better food than expected - make reservation in case the line is long. It also has just about the same breakfast reservations as the Leaky Caldron. 
Inside Islands of Adventure, this is a excellent restaurant that has great food along with great value. I got the 1/2 rotisserie chicken platter. Along with the chicken comes sliced potatoes and corn on the cob. The chicken has great skin on it and is good sized. The sliced potatoes are flavored very well and the corn on the cob is excellent when you add a butter and salt to it. For only $12.99 you get all these items. For a drink I got the lemonade which was refreshing. You never have to look for a seat at this restaurant as somebody from the restaurant will point you out a seat. Overall a excellent restaurant with excellent theming. 
Good atmosphere if you love be Harry Potter. Fish and chips was yummy. Frozen butter beer was better than regular. Long line but it goes quick. 
Not sure if it’s the chefs, or if Universal is scaling back on ingredients. But the food no longer has any flavor to it. And because it’s so overpriced you would think the portions would be bigger. They aren’t!!! So highly disappointed. 
Busy so go during off hours. We went at 11am. Didn’t wait very long but around noon line is out the door. Wonderful fish and chips. Get butterbeer here. Great atmosphere. Chicken with corn and potatoes was good also. 
OK food. Husband and I got ribs.. OK nothing special. Corn over done, potatoes over cooked. Expensive for the quality. As for park food its better than others.
This restaurant is located in Hogsmeade village . It has a quick service restaurant and bar . The ambience resembles the movie . Be sure to check bathrooms around the corner looking for ghosts . The bar has butter beer frozen and hot . There is a full bar as well . There is a patio where you can eat overlooking Hogwarts castle . The food is good for quick service and moderately priced . 
Overpriced breakfast! I don’t recommend eating here unless you have to. The breakfast was actually ok. We were a family of five eating there for the experience and for free through our AAA. We all liked it but I never would recommend it for the price.
Atmosphere was great. Food was mediocre. My Daughter and I shared the chicken and rib platter. The corn on the cob was not good, the potatoes were delicious , the meat was edible. My son had the turkey leg, and my mom ordered the fish and chips. They said their food was okay. We enjoyed tasting the drinks we ordered: butterbeer, pumpkin juice and pumpkin fizz. My son ordered a dark ale that was okay too. The staff at the front door were obnoxious and rude. Earlier my mother walked up to them to ask what time they started serving lunch since there were no hours posted. She politely said excuse me since they were talking. They ignored her and continued to talk. They knew she had a question, they turned their backs to her and continued talking about the same thing to each other over and over. She stood next to them and tried to ask again they looked at her and hen completely turned around. They were not talking about anything important related to work. I was getting extremely mad at their behavior and how they were acting. She gave up and walked back towards us as my adult son decided to go up to them. She was mad and said they were ignoring her. My son went up to them and loudly said sir twice before they acknowledged his existence and rolled their eyes at him and finally answered the question. I think we spent 5 minutes trying to get a question answered that should have taken 5 seconds. They were standing in the doorway to the restaurant and working as greeters. They obviously need to find other employment since they did not want to assist customers. We should have asked for a manager but didnt feel like taking the time out of our day to address it. The other employees were friendly.
This was the first place we ate while at the parks. First round was breakfast. Upon informing the cashier that my wife has a gluten allergy they asked us to wait while they got the chef. The chef came out and went over all of the options and what substitutions we could make to ensure the food was gluten free. We each got the american breakfast. My wife got hers with no sausage and no croissant. Instead they gave her extra bacon, eggs, and potatoes to balance the portion. It was all prepared wonderfully and we were satisfied (not bursting full) when we left. Service was great and the food was very tasty. We returned for lunch one day after the terrible handling of my wife's allergy at the the Leaky Cauldron (see my review). Again after informing the cashier of the allergy the chef came out and we got the same experience. The chef prepared ours separately and gave my wife extra portions to balance the portions. This place was a pleasure to eat at. 
Must have your butter beer fix while at the WWoHP! Was a bit shock to see that you also had to get in a line here to be ushered to cashier before ordering your food. Didn't eat just got the beer. Has a very nice outdoor seating at the back with a view of hogswarts castle. Staff is friendly. Next time I'll grab a bite.
We like the Three Broomsticks MUCH better then the Leaky Cauldron restaurant. The Three Broomsticks has better food, better atmosphere and friendlier service.
we ate lunch here to see how they recreated the place from the movies. It did not disappoint. The food was fine and a little pricey, atmosphere fantastic though. Get a seat inside, to fully immerse yourself. 
On our first day in the park we ate breakfast here and on our second day we ate lunch here. It was busy but the queue moved quickly. Food was tasty on both occasions. Overall we enjoyed both meals. 
"This restaurant is average at best. The staff are great and get people through the lines really quickly. The inside of the restaurant is amazing and makes you feel like you're in the movie. The food unfortunately is where things go downhill; I ordered the meat pies which were three bite sized ""pies"" that came with grocery store bagged salad. I would recommend people skip this place and go The Leaky Cauldron"
I was with Harry Potter friends so we had to eat here in Universal Studios. Food was good, but dessert was delicious! Quick serve restaurant.
We waited in a long line to even get in and once your in your shuffled around to a table like cattle. The food is overpriced. It’s like eating in Medieval Times. The food was terrible. Don’t bother. 
Excellent food and staff. It comes with meal plan or it might be a bit pricey but you got a lot of food enough for two.
There was a woman named Lashawn who gave me great advice about which kind of butterbeer to get (hot) and it really was the best! 
Since we are big harry potter fans we had to try this place at least once. whne entering we loved the whole decor and felt like right in the movie, they told us in entering how it would be till we had out food but actually it was half of that, bonus. was nto sure waht to get but had a bt of time . at this resturant, when we were there, we eated ourself and brought out food to the table, but as we left we saw it went back to normal where they seated you and brought your food to you. in comparing this to the Leaky caldron we like the food there a bit more. we felt we got bigger portions and better choices compared to here. butdon't get me wrong the food was good here and welcome back again just wanted to make sure you know where to go, which is both,
First and foremost the atmosphere here is amazing! The employees are so nice and stay in character. The food is amazing! For the quantity and quality of the food you got compared to the other park food places this just put the rest to shame. Will be eating here next time we come for sure! We had the rib and chicken meal and it was enough for the hubby and me. 
"I get it - it's a ""fantasy"" place, located within the Harry Potter land that lets fans keep the illusion going. With that being said, it was just ok. The theming is fantastic (as is ALL of the HP stuff at Universal) but the food left us feeling a little disappointed. The fish plate was ok, the kid's meals were ok, and the butterbeer/various other drinks are neat but the turkey leg was pretty bad. It's really just the same ol' theme park food (at those prices) in a fancy package. The kids thought it was cool and we enjoyed the experience, but don't expect culinary excellence beyond the usual carts outside the Hulk or Simpsons rides."
Our first morning (my birthday) in Universal we went to the Three Broomsticks for breakfast. As someone who has multiple food allergies and restrictions, they were extremely accommodating and pleasant. The meal was free for us (because of the passes from Cabana Bay), but it did appear that the prices were fairly hefty for people who didn't have the passes. 
Food was great! We got the fish and chips. We enjoyed The Leaky Couldren better (similar food). The staff was nice but were “into character” as much as other parts of the park. The set up isn’t super cozy either but it’s a fun experience for any Harry Potter lover!
We visited the 3 broomsticks whilst in the wizarding world Harry Potter As we are both huge HP fans, we just had to make the visit. We had the rib and chicken platter which was lovely, all freshly cooked and served with herby potatoes (but greasy for me but nothing wrong otherwise) and a huge ear of delicious corn on the cob. No problems with food and love the decor of the pub, it was a bit pricey but you are in a park and it's in line with other park eating prices so no problem there. All in all a nice experience and would visit again. 
We ate lunch here as a family after the Harry Potter experience. There was quite a long wait but the food was okay when we got it. Some of the prices were a bit high - particularly $4.50 for a small bottle Gilly water!! Their Cornish Pasties were tasty but nothing like a real Cornish Pasty so I was quite disappointed!!
Universal has a lot of restaurants and some of these are amazing but three broomsticks is a casual quick eats which is sometimes just what you need during a long day. We had the fish sticks and the combo of ribs and half chicken which was very filling. You definitely get what you paid for! The restaurant is very well organized and we hardly had to wait! Of course the details and aesthetic were super cool!!
Food is very expensive and lines can be very long, but the overall quality of food was pretty decent for a theme park. The desserts were especially imaginative. The ordering process can be a little difficult to comprehend, but servers/cashiers were happy to help.
Line was very long but moved quickly and efficiently. Food was actually quite tasty for as many people as they were serving. Get a Mac and cheese on the side! Overall very well organized and loved the decor.
Universal does a good job with this restaurant. Although there is a wait, it is well organized and the food is delivered quickly. It is a little pricey, but no complaints from the four of us.
We ate here this week and loved it! Our food was great and the staff very nice. It started raining as we entered so there were tons of people sitting at tables and not leaving. Then tons of people pulling in to keep dry. The staff was very nice and helpful. We had a spill because a rude lady ran over my 7 year old in her quest for our table but the nice man seating us quickly fixed the rude lady and got us taken care of. Love the ribs! We will be back! 
Quality of Food is pretty stunning for a fast-service location. I guess thats why it is so crowded at lunchtime, everybody wants to get in there. Be prepared for a healthy wait - they have a good system for metering the number of people who enter, running them through a queue where you can make your decisions on what's available, and then paying. Unfortunately for us, the person who was actually filling our order wasn't as efficient and the wonderfully designed system broke down because of one person. Other than that, the quality of food was fantastic, highly recommend the corn on the cob, chicken, ribs, and even the shepard's pie. Everything was delicious!
"Although I wasn't expecting anything amazing. This place really didn't deliver. ""Fish and chips"" was 3 pieces of fish and 9 chips. 9!! Other half had chicken and chips but the chicken was so tough the cheap plastic cutlery broke cutting it. Asked for metal knife and fork and was told there were none. The beer was good but at $9 per cup it has a bit of an aftertaste! Along with having to queue 20/25 minutes just to get into this place, was really let down by the whole experience. "
We went for breakfast and both got the traditional. I got pumpkin juice and it was like a spiced apple juice... delicious! My husband really liked the potatoes and I really liked the grilled tomato and sausage. Great atmosphere too! Harry Potter fans = must!!
We are passholders, and usually choose to eat outside the parks at Citywalk just for the quality of food. However, we just recently ate at 3 Broomsticks, and it was delicious. There was a little bit of a wait, so get there early for lunch if you want to avoid the wait. I got the fish, and my hubby got the chicken and ribs platter. Both were delicious, and they were also very generous portions. The inside of the restaurant is very detailed and authentic, just like the rest of the Wizarding World, and made for a fun atmosphere. Just a side note though, they do not serve any soda in the restaurant, so you are limited to butterbeer, tea, lemonade, beer, or water. Wasn't as issue for us, but I overheard another family talking about it. If you have the chance to go eat here though, do it! It was a great lunch.
The food was delicious. I had shepards pie, it was a good hearty portion and came wih Salad. It was worth the money spent and not your typical theme park fare.
We only had breakfast here and at the leaky caldron (same at both places) because they came with our hotel stay...A word to the wise. Use one voucher per two people...We had breakfast everyday this way and rarely did we finish all the food. Our two days of included breakfast stretched to 4 days
If you are a big Harry Potter fan it will be hard for you to pass up an opportunity to dine at the Three Broomsticks, site of so many great moments from the series. The good news, is that while the line can some times be intimidating the experience is thoughtfully designed and worth the wait.  The menu features English fare and a few kids options, most of the entrees come in between $10-18 USD and are decent sized portions. The quality of the food is nothing special, I had the Fish & Chips which was average, but most importantly I didn't leave hungry.  The seating area has lots of tables and has enough going on that your eyes will be wandering the room for the entire meal. Overall I'd say go for the atmosphere, not the food and you won't be disappointed!
Our family of 4 decided to eat at the Three broomsticks while visiting Harry Potter world in Universal Islands of Adventure. It did not disappoint and what we got we felt like we got our money's worth. (which is saying a lot when you are talking about eating anywhere in Universal.) We had the roasted chicken breast, corn and potato plate. There was a line to get in, but they moved fast to serve customers and get you seated.
There were lots of tables. Went October on a Tuesday not very busy. Got there at 1pm and waited about 20 minutes for a table. Got the 4 person platter. It was good, lots of food, felt like it could have fed 5 people. Came with chicken, ribs, veggies, potatoes, corn and salad. It was all good but the corn wasn't the best. Also got butter beer and beer there. They had lots of staff keeping the area clean. Would go back. Detail is great from the movie.
Surprisingly fast service from ordering to picking up. Quality of food is what you expect from this kind of restaurant.. Choice of menu is quite wide and is quite reasonably priced. All in all a good place for a quick meal.
An absolute joy to eat here! My party and I were a bit damp from the steady drizzle of the day and ready to get into a dry place to eat. The decor is basically something you would imagine in the Harry Potter universe. Service type is Quick service/counter ordering. I ordered the fish and chips, Butterbeer potted creme, and pumpkin juice. After you order, a host asks how many in your partyThe food was good, good pieces of thick, flaky fish. Both the fish and the chips could have been crispier though. The Butterbeer potted creme came in an adorable jar (I almost wanted to take it home!) and was very sweet, tasted more like butterscotch. The pumpkin juice was my favorite! It was refreshing, nicely spiced, and not too sweet. Almost like a pumpkin cider. Would definitely come here again!
This place is amazing. I just feel like I'm in the movie, waiting for Harry or Ron to walk through the door. The food was pretty good too. 
My husband and I enjoyed breakfast within Hogsmeade on the second day of our Universal trip, and were pleased as pumpkin juice with the service at The Three Broomsticks. Our vegetarian breakfasts were tasty, the environment was charming, and the wait staff kind, helpful, and entertaining. Our only suggestion on that rainy visit would be to have an actual fire going within the fireplace. *clinks butterbeer mugs*
Stopped here for food during Halloween horror nights. As we are from England we loved being able to have traditional food for once. Pretty sure it was just microwaved but very good anyway. Staff were super friendly and quick service. 
This place is not quite as well organized as The Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley. Waiting for food can involve confusion with other customers, and management really should straighten that out. There is as much atmosphere as you can really expect, given the modern technology and the other patrons. But you know, if you are tired and really need a sit-down in Hogwarts, this is your place. There is a reasonable range of options, and the prices are not much more inflated than resort prices generally. Do take a look at the displays of menu options, while you are in line to reach an ordering station. We enjoyed the Cornish pasties with garden salad. Our only complaint is that we expected more in the way of pasties, but maybe that's just because of how we make them at home. They were quite tasty (just a little bit spicy), and the baked crust was wonderful. And honestly, in the middle of a resort vacation, a meal that was mostly salad was probably a good thing. The kids really enjoyed the Frozen Butterbeer, but if you go for Pumpkin Juice, you will also be pleased.
After spending a morning in the park we decided to stop here for some lunch before exploring Hogsmeade further. As a Harry Potter fan I was excited to try The Three Broomsticks. There was a longish que to order but all tills were open and they que moved quickly.The menu has good enough choice and have healthier options such as salads alongside classic British fare such as Sheperds Pie, Fish and Chips.Inside was extremely busy and there would have been a wait for a table but there is a late seating area outback with views of Hogwarts so we ate there and it was lovely.I had the Chicken Salad and it was very tasty with plenty of chicken breast while my boyfriend tried the Sheperds Pie which was served with a fresh corn on cob. He said it was tasty especially the corn. We both tried the Lemonade too and it was thirst quenching and ideal for the hot day.Given where you are eating it a little expensive but was enjoyable. As we were leaving it was quiter so we were able to have a look about inside which was great.
This lunch was all about the atmosphere and the experience. The food wasn't bad, I had the Cornish Pasties which were tasty, but the salad with it was just so so. This was more about the ambience than the food though, and I appreciated every minute of it. Expect line ups, but they move pretty quickly. 
We looked for something to eat as we were starving heading over to IOA from Universal Studios. I accidentally ended up here and found the place cramped, the butterbeer was terrible yet the food (a kids meal fish and chips) were excellent. The butterbeer not being nice has nothing to do with the Three Broomsticks, i haven't rated it down for that. I rated down as the place is very busy and very cramped. We went on a quiet day too. For some reason you have to seated only when you have ordered, which I find strange as the service area is like a canteen. You pay, get the food then head to a table. We ended up sandwiched between lots of tables. Pretty weird. I like the theming and I expected it but I've been to better places at Universal and I find it unfair to rate this 5* when I ate better food elsewhere at Universal and sat in nicer places at Universal too. I would still recommend this place as it's a must for Potter fans and the food is nice, remember, kids meals and fish and chips are unreal. Maybe visit later at night when the park gets a little quieter so you won't be squashed together?
We really enjoyed our 2 meals at the Three Broomsticks! It's certainly not your typical theme park food. Between our 2 visits we tried the fish and chips, the rotisserie chicken, and the turkey leg. The roasted potatoes and corn on the cobb are great sides. We also got a salad that was tasty. Of course, get the butter beer ( the frozen was our favorite) and the pumpkin fizz is actually really yummy too!! This place is definitely worth the stop. It gets busy so plan to eat a little early or a little late. 
The food at the three broomsticks was surprisingly good value considering we was in a theme park. We didn’t have to wait too long for the food. Good sized portions The corn on the cob was very tender and very flavoursome. Worth a visit 
This is one of my families favorite restaurants in the park along with The Leaky Cauldron. The food is good (Fish and Chips is our favorite) and the portions are good. It is a little pricey but not horrible but it is in a theme park so that is expected. They do not serve soft drinks in the Wizarding world but you will not miss them with all the other options you have. The Dragon Brew is an nice adult beverage and the kids will enjoy the butter beer. 
The Three Broomsticks is one of two Harry Potter-themed restaurants. I would rate the food as OK - nothing special although the butter beer flavored desserts were good. Certainly as good or better than most of the other theme park food you can get at Universal that is in the theme parks.
This is the best theme park food- we liked it so much we ate there twice! Portions are large and food is tasty plus the atmosphere is super cool. I had the rotisserie chicken with potatoes and corn on the cob both times, but had the chocolate strawberry trifle the first time and the butterbeer cream pot the second time. Both desserts were good, but not really anything special - unlike the ButterBeer icecream! Next time, I'd save my calories for eating more ice cream! Prices are typical theme park high, but the inside had shade and air conditioning which can be priceless in Florida.
Seven of us ate lunch here and it was very good. When you first arrive, it looks like it's going to be a nightmare because it's fairly busy at peak times but the staff do a great job of organising everyone. There is a queue outside that is monitored by staff. They let people enter the food ordering queue once there is capacity. There is plenty of opportunity to view the menu, which is limited, but adequate. Once you order, you move along to food pickup and then utensil and condiment area. When you're all set to eat, a staff member coordinates with floor staff to find you a suitable table. All very efficient. I love that they don't allow table hogs - you know, those people that hog a table while someone else goes to order the food. Then they sit there for 20 minutes waiting for food and taking up an otherwise usable table for those who actually have food. We saw that a lot at Disney quick serve restaurants and it really causes congestion. In general, we all found something we could order, mostly either chicken or fish. The chicken is roasted and kind of dry but otherwise tasty, It could benefit from an offer of bbq sauce or gravy I think. The potatoes were also roasted and mine were quite seasoned and spicy but my sister's were plain so it seems a bit variable. An extra yummy item was the full roasted corn on the cob. It was quite fresh and sweet, not chewy like a lot of other places. Very delicious! We enjoyed our lunch but I will admit that this restaurant doesn't have quite as much atmosphere as The Leaky Cauldron. If you're going to pick only one Harry Potter restaurant, we preferred The Leaky Cauldron but Three Broomsticks is also a very good choice.
If you wish to have a meal in a Harry Potter restaurant, pick the other. It has more choice of food and drink.Inside is very authentic and looks good. If you visit the other and decide to eat here, there are some food options they have not heard of, eg Toad in the Hole.Try avoid busy periods and be expected to pay more than the average.
This is the best food I have ever had at a theme park. They give you large portions for not a lot of money. You have to try the butter bear tpo.
as with every tourist attraction, food is pricey and nothing out of the ordinary for breakfast, but definitely try the Butter Beer and the Apple cider! Out of this world!!
Great spot for breakfast or afternoon meal stop. Good food, american and traditional British fare, portions are good size and the staff doesn't mind people wandering around to take photos
What a feat to pull off: Running a restaurant, having very good food, and staying in character the entire time! As with everything at this park, the attention to detail in the design (interior as well as exterior) was nothing short of phenomenal!
Long wait to get served and then queue at the counter for food. There doesn't seem to be anyone managing the queues or the queuing stations which makes it shambolic. Waited 25 mins for a kids Mac and cheese which was cold when I finally got it.. Note: kids meals with fries are enough for an adult, if you don't fancy anything off of the normal menu.
We get the combo rib and chicken meal which comes with corn on the cob and roasted potatoes and have found it to easily feed two persons. The food is very good here and there is normally no waiting. This and Thunder Falls are the two best choices for good meals. 
Visiting feels like a dream come true for real HP fans. All the food is decent, but your really visiting for the atmosphere and the experience. You want to at least pop in for a butter beer.
As most people do, we hit the park for early for rides and breakfast at the Three Broomsticks but guess what, Hogsmeade doesn't open till 9:00am. Tip is to get a ride at Gringotts early and train over to Hogsmeade for breakfast. Since we ate at the Leaky Cauldron previously, this breakfast seemed better. The pancakes with bacon and sausage also had a croissant and was quite tasty and significant enough. You also get a drink for $16.99, expensive but worth the experience. 
Amazing setting, but food poor and staff absolutely miserable. I wished we'd just got a photo and moved on.
We had to queue for around half an hour for this place before we were actually sat down with our food. We both had turkey legs. I quite enjoyed mine but my partner didnt like it. The pumpkin juice is disgusting, do not get it!
How many moviegoers wouldn't love to reenact a scene from one of their favorite movies enjoying a meal on the set. This is what it is like when you enjoy a meal at the Three Broomsticks. It's pricey compared to non-park traditional eating facilities, but a good bargain for eating in the park (where all the prices are higher). You get plenty of food, and as you enter they have not only the menu and prices listed, but they also have a display (not sure if they are wax or plastic) of what each meal looks like. The staff also do their best to remain in character adding to the atmosphere of being a part of the books or movies. It's a really great value and choice.
Great choice of food available the platter for sharing is worth the money enough to feed four .Atmosphere really good great for all ages to eat 
We thought we'd eat at the park whilst waiting to do a late show . Don't normally like park food, we did our research and that salad fresh vegetables and potatoes will be just what we needed during a 2 week Orlando adventure!!!!!This place sure didn't disappoint. Food was tasty fresh hot and really really yummy !!!!Great value , we had the grand feast and it sure was grand !!!!Would we recommend.... hell yeah !!!!
"We had a large group of 9. We decided to do 2 of the ""feasts"" on the menu. We all ate till our fill and had food left over. Everything tasted great. "
Great food with a nice choice of menu.The room was decorated very well. The wonderful staff were attentive and very pleasant.
Fantastic chicken and ribs, theming excellent and plenty of helpful cast members to show you to a seat so no waiting 
Although the turkey leg and chicken strips were not very good, the theme of the restaurant certainly made up for it. The food was not the worst I've had, but it wasn't the best I've had either. The only thing on the menu that was good was the fish and chips. After having waited almost an hour, we weren't even satisfied with the food. I would give it an average.
We rushed here for a bite as a lot of the food establishments closed at 6pm!!! As the park was closing at 7pm the inside is excellent, only one person taking orders and took about 20 mins to be served even though about 5 families in front of us. The fish and chips and chicken and ribs was delicious however the pasties were vile!! 3 tiny pasties which were described as full of vegetables and potatoes. They were dark brown and for nearly $10 really disappointing A shame really as the rest was Great 
My title says it all. The seating strategy, was to seat one group at a time, regardless if there is room for others. Meaning: in front of us (we were 2 people), was a party of 5. We were kept waiting for the party of 5 to be seated, even though everyone in line (plenty of groups) could plainly see several tables for 2 ready and empty.We spoke up, but got the 'this is our policy' answer. Pathetic!!!
My first visit to Universal as an annual pass holder and we stopped here for a butterbeer and something light. I got soup and salad and my husband ordered the pasties (photo attached). Do NOT believe the photos in the restaurant - these things were TINY! My biggest complaint, however, is quite possibly with worst staffing I have ever run into in a fast food setting. They had ONE register open at 4 pm - when the young lady at the door approached her manager to ask if another register could be opened, she as told a flat no. We stood in line to approach the single register, with no exaggeration, for over 30 minutes! I myself saw 4 cooks in the kitchen standing around and doing absolutely nothing. I honestly would not recommend this venue to anyone! 
Early entry to Islands of Adventure and specifically the Wizarding World of Harry Potter make this an excellent drop off for breakfast having spent two hours on the rides before the crowds arriveFab location in centre of Hogsmeade. Marvellous interior with great theming. I am sure that I saw Harry, Ron and Hermione.Traditional breakfast fayre but American and English and Continental versions on offer. Frankly more than one person can eat and very good quality dare I say for a theme park. It is not a theme park, it is Hogsmeade. Alright Harry?A useful innovation is that they display plated up versions of each breakfast dish so you know what you are getting. You are then guided to your station for ordering so everything is well controlled and stress free
The themeing is amazing and sucks you right into the experience. The food is really not bad and the service was reasonably quick for the two meals we ate here. 
Truly felt like I was in the book and eating at the Three Broomsticks. The food was delicious and very reasonably priced, which was a huge bonus. If you have 4-6 people, definitely order the great feast. It was delicious and well worth the price for that many people. 
Setup here needs work. Leaky cauldron was better by a lot. Service folks here bored and frustrated. A few were rude and impatient. Food was good but due to service killed the moment. Again amazing scenery.
The restaurant is so cool because it feels like you're in the movie! Try the pumpkin juice. The kids meals are great. We went in 2013. 
Lots of food!!! We have a family of five and ordered the Great Feast for four, it can feed six easily. The food was cooked and seasoned well. We enjoyed the food and the rest. Will visit again.
"Honestly so much better than ""amusement park food"". This was an experience. the Castle that the restaurant was in was incredible. The way it was organized was very unique. I was impressed and very full after dinner. "
We ate here while staying at Universal Orlando. Breakfast was included as part of our package. If it had not been, I would have felt ripped off. It was a neat experience and the atmosphere was spot on. Prices for lunch and dinner seemed more reasonable. Don't go for breakfast unless it's part of the package.
I love Harry Potter as much as the next person and our family went here for the experience. It didn't disappoint in that respect. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. A bit overpriced and nothing spectacular. Turkey legs were dry and chewy. Potatoes were cold and undercooked. Fish and chips were decent. Salads were basic greens. Realize you are paying for the atmosphere and go with that. Don't expect a gourmet meal at a theme park where they are feeding thousands a day. 
The food is pretty good. Salads good be fresher. I actually liked the Leaky Cauldron better. The breakfast and lunch we had were very good there.
Not great value. Ordered the soup and salad. The portions were small. Okay for a bite if you are in a hurry.
Eat at the Three Broomsticks whilst visiting Universal Islands of Adventure, you pay for the setting that is truly amazing but the food is over priced and poor quality.
Be prepared for resort pricing. Try to go early to avoid peak meal times and the crowds. The food is generally good and presented in an interesting manner in keeping with the theme. Kids of all ages will enjoy the experience. The environment can be very noisy when the facility has large numbers of guests.
Being great Harry Potter fans, we loved eating here. Since we were a part of the VIP tour, lunch was free for us or rather included in the VIP price. Butter beer, turkey leg, fries, salad all yumm. Great experience and you can either eat inside or sit outside overlooking the castle.
Food was ok, my boys liked the ribs, pretty costly though. My daughters kids meal made us laugh, very small amount of food, her applesauce wasn't even as big as the Mott's cups from the grocery, only about 2 tablespoons worth in a little cup you would see used for ketchup.
eating at the three broomsticks is just enjoying the atmosphere of the restaurant. you can choose to sit inside or sit outside to look over the castle. the food served here is basically the same food served anywhere else; butter beer, turkey leg, fries and salad. line up is quite long when we were there.the atmosphere is excellent, food were just typical theme park food!
"We are passholders so we've been here many times and tried nearly everything on the menu. I have to say, while the atmosphere is always neat, the food is hit or miss. The portions are pretty small, and the food seems more cafeteria-like than other dining options. However, if you are a harry Potter fan it's a must-see. You will wait in line (if your timing is bad, you will wait a while) to order your food. You are then given a number and sent to another line. There you are given your tray of food and drinks. Then you have to find a seat. At very busy times there is someone available to find a table for you. It can get pretty packed, so it's not uncommon to ""rub elbows"" with the people seated around you. Overall, do it just to say you did. If you're looking for high quality food over atmosphere and experience, go somewhere else."
Had eaten here before and just walked in, ordered some good food and grabbed a table without a problem. Obviously since then the Three Broomsticks has become a victim of its own success. Turned up at about 1.45pm only to be faced with a 30 minute queue to even get to the order point.Food was really good, as was the butter beer. The theming inside is excellent.Don't have a solution to the queuing issue but whilst eating we did notice at least a dozen empty tables even though the queue of waiting patrons was still out the door.
We ate here while visiting the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and man it was tasty. My son and I shared a normal platter of the fish and chips and they were oh-so-good. Very light and not greasy at all. We also got a butterbeer, lemonade, and a pear cider. All of which were great. They do not have lids for their drinks, however, which makes it hard to take to go with a 9 year old.
This isn't a restaurant where you are seated then waited on. It's a quick serve, que to order, que for food, find a table, eat and go. Would be lovely if upstairs was open just for an area to relax with a cool drink in the air con. Food is mass produced but still quite tasty although overpriced. Watching the Hog behind the bar was fun. Ask for its nose to be tickled! Overall the Leaky Cauldron has a more enjoyable atmosphere. Both places offer different food choices so check out their menus.
Everyone wants t o go here for a meal - of course -- but if you are a vegetarian, it is sadly, not for you!
The theme of the restaurant is great, if you love all things Harry Potter. We had to wait for a while for a table for 5 but it was lunch time. There's not huge selection on the menu but we all found something we liked. The food was adequate.
We had lunch here. Good Food and fun atmosphere. There was a lign up outside the door but they were efficient so the wait wasn't long. My daughter has allergies so the chef came out to discuss our concerns. The fish and chips were good as well as the roasted chicken and potatoes. My son loved the chicken tenders. Would definitely go back.
Enjoyed our counter service breakfast here. Very expensive for breakfast, however lots of food and my kids loved eating in the Harry Potter themed restaurant. The food quality was very good. We tried the American breakfast and the Pancake breakfast. Certainly not worth the price unless you or your children are big Harry Potter fans.
Ate breakfast here. It was okay not as good as Leaky Cauldron but one of the best meals I had while at Universal. The Hogshead bar next door (joining on the side) had better service.
Breakfasted here one day during our stay but food is bland and disappointing. Had a drink in the bar in the evening - atmospheric, fun and good selection.
We ate lunch here, and even though we didn't have a notification the wait was still pretty short. The food was amazing, we got fish and chips and they were delicious. The detail is really good, just like the movies. I highly recommend Otter's Fizzy Orange Juice or Butterbeer. They are both good.
Food isn't great, but okay for a theme park. The line system is flawless, so even on a busy July day at 1:00 we got right through and had no problem getting a table. The layout/feel is incredible. Full bar in the back (Hog's Head) and the HP beers are surprisingly good. 
We had ribs and roasted chicken and they were both delicious, the potato and corn was perfect. Generous servings and a good price. Plenty of places to sit and enjoy the experience.
The young woman at the bar knew her stuff Long wait but we were inside Worth a stop no wizards brew but good other beverages
Ate breakfast here at 9:00 am on a Sunday, although we had reservations we really didn't need them. It was peak season in the middle of July with zero wait. Food was tasty but limited. Not a large selection, cafeteria style. ambiance was awesome. Staff was nice, helpful and accommodating, mid-level priced.
Great set up and authentic but the service overall was very poor. The place was half empty and staff were annoying people with directions for seating. The food is okay and overpriced. Staff need to remember where they are the amount of money people on spending on excited children (and in some cases adults)
The wait is crazy but worth it. The food is nice. I had shepherds pie and my daughter had chicken and chips. Chicken nuggets and chips for my 4 year old. But overall it was nice and made a change. 
As always, my opinions and experiences might differ from yours or everybody else's but for my family, this was an outstanding lunch experience.We bought our lunch on the Universal Studios Dining Plan so our menu was a little bit more limited than if we were buying in-store. Sadly, that meant we were NOT able to choose the chicken & ribs plate OR the meal-for-four combo.However, the smoked rotisserie chicken WAS on the adult menu and it was fantastic! The chicken was succulent and tasty, seasoned well and cooked beautifully. Although the corn tasted a bit like it had caramelized a little, it was still very good and the potatoes were delicious as well.My wife ordered the Fish & Chips but did not enjoy it so much. I thought her Fish meal was simply ordinary. The kids had chicken tenders with fries. They allowed us to sample their meal and it was quite good. They finished it all off - nuff said.Loved the atmosphere. Could have used a little better seating arrangements. There was a bench seat on one side of the table and uneven chairs on the other. We all sat at different heights. I got the point of it but thought that looks could have been enough and the actual seating more comfortable for adults after that.We did not have to wait. We dined around the lunch hour in mid-July, but on a Monday. Apparently, Monday is one of the least busiest days for the park. Given that ANYthing at an Orlando theme park is going to be way overpriced and ESPECIALLY food I thought we received very good quality/quantity for the cost. Staff were friendly and very helpful. We will definitely consider this restaurant again when we return to Harry Potter world.Service ... 5 starsAtmosphere ... 5 starsTaste ... 4 starsValue ... 5 starsOverall ... 4.75 stars
Naturally, it's peak holiday season; this place is simply 'process over people. I was a customer of their food side, Three Broomsticks, and then at the beverage side, the Hog's Head (it is all one establishment actually). As soon as you move from the table (to buy more drinks) a 'reserved' sign is thrown on to the table by hawkish waiting staff - reserved for incoming 'new new customers only.'As an existing customer returning with newly purchased drinks, I can't now seat my family. The Manager is confrontational with limited ability to reason that as I am a customer of his establishment in effect three times, I will and do seat, my family regardless.The Manager steps into my personal space as he's lost the ability to tell me that as an existing customer I have to stand up! So he tells me 'he'll call security.' We finish our drinks and leave, never to return.Guest Services will listen to complaints but are powerless to make any real difference. Day-to-day management staff are on broadcast not helping customers manage and enjoy - they're just 'get 'em in, thow 'em out!'J.K. Rowling, anything you can do to improve the customer experience here would be appreciated. Perhaps less process more about the people.
Had to eat here. We had Fish & Chips and a butterbeer each.Food was delicious and the place was full of character.Loved it
Had lunch at this resturant and although very good, it was an outrageous wait to get in 45mins; with two children in tow, it's not good. Once in its cool and surroundings not bad. Service good. Staff courteous and friendly and help you to table. 6 meals to choose from, and they are good, very limited with soft drink selections and definetly not cheap.
COuld not get enough of the Harry Potter while we were at universal. Food was great, high priced like any theme park, but worth it for the full HP experience.
The Great Feast is delicious, and plenty of food for more than four people. The kids meals are the perfect size for adults. So don't be afraid to order one. 
"We dined here for lunch - the line out front was long but our tour guide said it would go quickly and she was right. We were glad we took her advice and our 10-year old loved it. You wait in line to order and the food is put on trays so as soon as you are done ordering you walk over to the pick up line and it is a short wait for food. Staff is great and while you are in line they ask how many in your party and reserve a table. that makes it a breeze as you they direct you to a table as you carry the trays. They were very accommodating for a member of our party in a wheel chair. We tried the soup and salads (split pea was delicious), roasted chicken on salad, and roasted garlic potato wedges and roasted corn. They serve Butter Beer (frozen as well) and it was a great accompaniment to lunch. The cashier was very helpful as we were using Quick Service Dining Cards (highly recommend, saved us a lot of money) and she helped us by telling us to order a regular beverage that comes with a meal and then use the ""snack"" option for the frozen Butter Beer - that is the most expensive snack option for the cards and by far the best value. We really appreciated that tip!"
I liked this restaurant better than I did the Leaky Cauldron...both the atmosphere and the food. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Large portions of good food. And it is on the Quick Service dining plan!
We enjoyed the food and watching the Potter fans in robes with wands eating alongside the tourist types....shorts and t shirts. Avoid busy meal times and you will get right in.
A varied menu that will please most people. If you are hungry and at Universal Studio in Orlando Florida, skip the fast food kiosks and go to this restaurant for some different and yet traditional flavors.
Not impressed with the food. Over priced. It does offer a nice air conditioned place to sit and take a break with a butter beer.
"Breakfast here was really good! The only complaint I have is that when I asked the girl at the register if the beans had meat in it (my family is vegetarian) the girl rolled her eyes and said ""hang on I'll go get the chef"" in an aggravated voice. The chef was really nice though and answered all my questions and it all worked out. It was a cool place to eat, we really liked it."
My favorite meal in the area! Loved the fish and chips. The restaurant was roomy and cool. Self serve pretty much. Could have eaten here every day and saved a bundle.
When at Universal, we always stop for lunch or dinner here. There are four of us in my family, including a teen boy and and ten year old. We buy the family meal which includes a whole chicken, ribs, salad, corn and potatoes and have never been disappointed with the taste and quantity.
My husband, two 20s children and I ate lunch at the Three Broomsticks during our exploration of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal's Island of Adventure. Being huge fans of the Harry Potter series, we enjoyed eating in this section of the park. We finished all the rides in Hogsmeade by 11:00 and decided to eat lunch. This turned out to be a wise decision because although there was no line to order and plenty of seating when we arrived, it was extremely crowded an hour later when we left. We ordered the platter for four ($59.99) which gave us plenty of food for $15.00 per person. You first go to a register and order your meal. They immediately gave us our four salads and drinks and escorted us to a table. We were seated right next to the cauldron hanging in the fireplace and across from the bar. We tried the regular butter beer ($6.99), the frozen butter beer ($6.99) and some pumpkin juice ($4.99) because these were all featured in the books. The butter beer had a butterscotch taste and we all preferred the frozen version with the frothy cream on top. The pumpkin juice had a cinnamon taste to it. For our meal, a large metal platter was served to us and it contained smoked chicken, spareribs, corn on the cob, and roast potatoes. We felt it was a healthy and tasty lunch, especially for a theme park.
This is defienetly a quick stop in meal while your in the park. Don't expect any service because it's kind of a sit and eat quick kinda meal. The staff that took our order were of course GREAT but from that point your on your own so expect that. The food was greasy. I got the cod and fries and so did my children but it was super greasy and my husband got the ribs and they were really dry. Overall we ate here because it was on the dining plan and had good reviews but we were really disappointed in the food. Bummer.
The setting is exactly the same as the movie. I love their breakfast, great choice and price is very fair.
Chef was reassuring with regards a Gluten allergy. Lots of choice from soups, salads, ribs & chicken all suitable for those with Gluten allergy
"The food was fine but entrees average $14 and drinks about $3.50. You order at a register, then you move to a pickup window that corresponds to your register number (but nobody tells you that and it's not on your receipt), then you head over to a guide who finds you an open table. You have to exit if you need a bathroom-- nearby--which kind of makes you look like you're jumping the line to get back in. Vegetarian option not stated on the menu is basically three sides (if you're on the meal plan, together that makes one ""entree""). British pub fare such as fish and chips, cornish pasties, shepherd's pie, turkey leg. Pumpkin juice tastes like pumpkin spice drinks, which I like as a coffee or tea but not as an iced cold drink. Butterbeer tastes like butterscotch; has a foamy head that some children don't like. Apple cider is fine; it's served with ice. Crowded. No express pass, ha ha. Line outside has no shade."
Grabbed breakfast during Early Entry and enjoyed the atmosphere. Also enjoyed some down time on the patio out back with a nice view of Hogwarts. I returned everyday for my adult treat of Hogs Tea at the Pub. It's my new favorite thing in the Park 
Had a lovely lunch here with my son reasonably priced good quality food staff were very friendly and helpful especially as they work in a very busy and warm environment first class all round ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
We had high hopes given the previous reviews. All I can say is don't go for breakfast. The food was cold and tasteless and expensive for this poor quality. Unusually for our family, we left the food which gives you an indication of how bad it was. Avoid for breakfast. 
We went for dinner and luckily picked an off time so we did not have to wait in line. We all had the roasted chicken and ribs with veggies. We were all really surprised how much we enjoyed our meal. Butterbeer is also offered here. Great place for a break inside HP World!
We were pleasantly surprised by Three Broomsticks. We didn't love most of the restaurants that we tried at Universal, but this was definitely the exception. The food was tasty and the atmosphere was great. Definitely worth trying while in the park
We went here for the first time and had lunch. The food was good. It was crowded and we waited in line (long line) so try to go during off meal hours. The selections are limited but there was something we each liked. The nice thing is that after you order and get your food (from a second line), the hostess will find you a table to sit at.
I had the soup(split pea & ham) & salad plate-very good. Hubby had grilled chicken salad. The grandkids had the mac & cheese & ribs. Dght. & SIL had grilled chicken with corn on the cob, then they all shared a couple of apple pies. The restaurant is pretty good sized so the waiting is not too long. The staff is nice: you walk in and order then go to the cooking area to pick up the food and take it to your table. I have eaten there before & will again. Good food 
The food was better than expected. I was disappointed with the Butterbeer. It reminded me of Shasta cream soda. Nothing wrong with that, but I can buy a case of Shasta cream soda for cheaper than the cost of one Butterbeer. I would recommend buying one just to say you've had it.
It is a must try! The decor is exactly as seen in the movies. They offer various options, the shepherds pie, turkey leg, roasted chicken and ribs are delicious! Must try the butter beer ice cream and the chocolate trifle! They also offer kids menus!
We are big HP fans so we thought this would be a great choice for lunch! The line was length but moved quickly. Pricing was comparable to grab and go food at park. But was much better we flat quality wise. Portions were large. We were very glad we went. And the ambience is true Harry Potter fashion! 
This place offered reasonably good food and lots of convenience. While crowded, the staff manage all of the people well. Incidentally, butterbeer tastes like a root beer with butterscotch, and a few swigs were plenty for us.
We had a reservation for our last morning at Universal, and thought it would be a great dining experience and we left very disappointed. The food was cold and disgusting. We each ordered a different breakfast and no one enjoyed thiers. My husband saw the kitchen staff pouring the precooked scrambled eggs from a large bag into the warming tray while we were standing at the pick up counter which is right in front of the kitchen area. I am not sure the sausage links had much sausage meat in them as they were mushy and tasted like low quality product with a lot of filler. The croissants were only o.k. not very flaky, kind of hard, like 2 day old bread . The scone was very processed and harder than a scone should be and the pancakes even tasted like the frozen kind we sometimes buy at home. The canelli beans were poured straight from a can. Obviously nothing was fresh prepared and no ones meal was hot or even warm. Very disappointing considering we paid $18 apiece. Only positive is the canteloupe and honey dew tasted good and the potatoes were edible, although greasy, cold and sparse. You Can't even get a free coffee or tea refill. We could have stopped at the Starbucks inside the park and paid $6 for an egg and cheese croissant which probably would have been a better tasting breakfast and saved ourselves alot of $.
For Harry Potter fans you have to check it out. It helped bring the story to life as we checked it out.We had breakfast there. Very average American style meal with eggs and potatoes. The real treat was having our first butterbeer.This place does take reservations but we walked in without a wait.
The four of us arrived later for dinner, around 7pm, as we were still operating on Mountain time. We quickly got in, no line. Ordered the massive family platter. My husband eats a ton and the four of us could not finish it. It was delicious!The service was subpar, but the atmosphere and food made up for the lack of hospitality.
Great ambiance! Well done to theme. Beer tastes great. Food is average theme park food rather than restaurant quality. 
This was my favorite themed restaurant in the WWHP area. We had the English style breakfast (rather than the standard American) and it was fabulous! Several types of sausages including the traditional blood sausage along with potatoes, beans, eggs, etc. It was quite filling! I recommend the pumpkin juice with this meal, since it adds a bit of sweet to offset the stronger tastes of the sausages. Seating was small tables, booths and large common tables (great for groups). The staff was friendly and efficient. Our food arrived really fast. It's a bit pricy, but well worth it.
Authentic decor and attempt at that with food - huge Turkey leg for instance, and real beer. However, the food was greasy and not that good, tho my daughter loved the turkey leg. Would never eat here again, but it's cute to walk in and see the decor.
We went here for breakfast during early park admission. We had reservations and waited maybe ten minutes before we got up to the counter. We placed our orders and got in line at the pickup windows. We waited a bit more and proceeded to our table to eat. A little tip, even though it is not listed on the menu board, they serve butterbeer here.
We were very impressed with the quality of the food for a theme park. I had the Shepards Pie which had very good flavour and came with a salad. Just the right amount of food. My husband had the Smoked turkey leg and raved about how delicious it was. It was huge!!! We got there right at lunch time so there was a line but it went pretty fast. There were 8 of us and they had a table waiting for us by the time we got all our food. I would eat here again in a heartbeat.
The food here is out of this world and the environment is spectacular it truly immerses you into the world of Harry Potter!I would highly recommend eating here on your trip!
Popped in here for a quick pint and nibbles with the kids whilst at Universal. The pub looks greats and the beer selection is very good for a park however the food was ridiculous. The Cornish pasties were the size and look of samosas. They were also beef.Universal, learn a lesson from Epcot and bring in some local chefs.
This is only one of two places open for breakfast. I thought the croissants were awful. My husband did enjoy his continental breakfast, but I like more protein in the morning. The food was very greasy. The english breakfast was no better than the american breakfast.
It is like being in an old English/European pub. They have both American and English breakfasts. For two platters (which include drinks) we paid about $30--it could feed 2 parents and one 9YO. Didn't care for blood sausage but potatoes and bacon were seasoned well. Scrambled eggs perfect. My son's pancakes were yummy--they don't have real maple syrup. The food is good and you get to enjoy the HP theme while eating.
The Great Feast seemed too big for us, so we ordered the Rotisserie Smoked Chicken Platter, Spareribs Platter and the Fish and Chips for my husband, twin 14 year old daughters, 9 year old son and myself and ended up with a FEAST of our own :). Obviously some of us are not big eaters so it was PLENTIFUL AND MAGICALLY DELICIOUS FOR THE FIVE OF US.The Three Broomsticks is definitely THE BEST restaurant of any of the Disney, Sea World or Universal theme parks...so here's another GOLD STAR for Universal being superior to Disney in my opinion. For big eaters, there are plenty of options at the Three Broomsticks. This is a must for all Harry Potter fans. The decor is AMAZING. I am THRILLED TO HAVE SAVED THIS RESTAURANT FOR LAST.
We had a LUSH lunch in the three broomsticks. As soon as we got there and saw the queue I was dreading waiting in it however was pleasantly surprised it took less than 10mins. This is a quick service place, you order your food and pay, go to a different area pick it up and get seated immediately.We both had the cod and chips and it was one of the best meals we had in all the parks we visited. Gorgeous food and amazing surroundings with helpful staff, what more could you possibly want. 
Unlike other parks, I really like the food at Universal. I like the Three Broomsticks because they have some healthy choices to actually fuel your body for the busy day at the park. There were some pieces of lettuce in my salad that were pretty sad so that's why I gave it only a very good .The inside, like the rest of the park, is absolutely perfect to the movies. Highly recommend you eat here.
My family ate here last weekend. It was great service and staff. Our food was not greasy like most theme park food. The chicken sandwich was wonderful. We had butter beer and pumpkin juice with our meal. 
We eat here almost every time we visit, food is great and I do like how they have the tables setup so there is always room for you to sit down. Don't skip on the Butterbeer Fudge!
Go for the experience...not the food. The food is not worth the wait and I think the corn on the cobs have gotten smaller over the years. My chicken salad had a bone in the chicken...this told me that the chicken was real but really? A bone? It almost choked me! The roll was also too hard.
Pricey, as expected for a restaurant inside a theme park, but we enjoyed the food and the overall attention to detail. They have streamlined the way things run and even tho there were many people, the wait for service and food was minimal. The food was pretty good too.
We decided to try eating here for the experience. We had to wait in about a 10 minute line or so to even be able to order our food. Then you walk up to a register and order, and then walk to a different counter to pick it up. You can clearly see each of the meals underneath a warming light, which gave me a dining hall vibe. Once you get your food, you wait for a host to show you to an open table, where the tables are arranged dining hall style. The lighting is very dark unless you are by a window. One thing I did not know is that you can substitute the side that your meal comes with for a different one. We ordered the shepherd's pie, and the chicken and ribs platter, as well as two frozen butterbeers (but they also have the standard soda kind as well). The shepherd's pie portion was extremely tiny, especially for the price! The mashed potatoes were hard and crusty on top from being under the warmer for so long. The ribs you could tell were clearly microwaved, same with the chicken, which was a chicken thigh, which was extremely dried out. (This platter was the second most expensive item on the menu!) Overall I was extremely disappointed in the food quality and taste, and especially disappointed with the prices! This place is overrated with dining hall vibe and food.
Fried food. Cafeteria Style. Go to City Walk or eat in the main part of Universal. Had a bad stomach after eating here.
Great value and taste, especially for theme park food! There was a long line, but service was quick!
We liked Three Broomsticks. It was a typical park lunch. The food was good, not fabulous. It is not table service...it is a food counter. The kids did like trying the frozen butter beer. I would say the overall experience was not good or bad...your typical food counter theme park food. 
We got a meal for four to share and had plenty for five. It was really good and reasonable prices. Of course we all got a delicious butter beer and inside the decor is so cute.
I had the fish and chips and added a side of corn on the cob and very much enjoyed my dinner. Hubby had chicken which was a bit dry ( what I had last time ) but overall everyone in Our group enjoyed our experience! The seasoned wedges were very good!!! 
I ordered the Cornish pasty and pictured is what I got for $9.99. There was maybe 1oz of meat in this entire meal. Do not order the Cornish pastry. It is not worth it.
The detail of the interior is incredible, no sign of modern utilities or infrastructure can be seen in the dining area. The weather tables and mismatched chairs add to the sense of being there. One of us was celebrating a birthday and was given a free desert. The Fish and Chips are authentic. Try the frozen Butterbeer.
Delicious food, good service.... Can't wait to go back. The Frozen butter Beer is delicious. Can't wait to return.
Casual dining that met our expectations. A little expensive but most things at Universal park are I mean you have to pay more than 100 dollars just to get in for one person at ONE park although I am not convinced we were able to use the express tickets to our advantage because we found out the many of the attractions did not allow their use.
Use your Dining Plan here. Best bang for the buck. Authentic. Restroom in the alley has ghosts in the bathrooms. :) Butter Beer!
This is a fun place to eat - the food was good (a little pricey though) but it's the atmosphere that's is great!
Eating here is just like stepping into a movie. The atmosphere is unbelievable. I kept waiting to see a house elf or goblin walk by. The food was average theme park quality. The main attraction was of course the butter beer. Warning, it is very sweet. Consider splitting one with someone. The ordering process was more organized than other restaurants in the theme park. It was great that they had cast members helping to seat you once you had your good. It is a great experience for any HP fan.
As I am such a Harry Potter nerd, I had to eat at the Three Broomsticks! We got breakfast - my husband had the American breakfast and I had the mushroom and leak pasty. Mine was delicious with food fresh fruit. These dishes included a drink but it was still very expensive. Look around and take in the sights!!
I had a salad and my husband had the turkey leg dish. Admittedly my husband had a beer, but I had an iced tea... not refillable. This meal cost us around $50 and honestly I would expect better food for that price, but alas, it's a theme park and everything is jacked up. Food was okay, I recommend the butter beer (frozen) over the pumpkin juice (like drinking an over spiced pumpkin pie)
This was our favorite place to eat inside the Wizarding World, with the Leaky Cauldron a close second. They did such a great job with the set, it looks like it came right out of the movies! I enjoyed looking up at the sets of wooden stairs and hallways above us as we ate, and the food is surprisingly delicious traditional British food. We ate lunch there twice.
I always eat here when I visit, sometimes twice, like this visit. Fish and Chips for me, and a frozen Butterbeer. I love everything about this wonderful place, staff, atmosphere, food, prices, and seating inside or outside. Please, if you are going to Universal Islands of Adventure, this is a must. You will not be disappointed.
You can tell this restaurant is right out of the Harry Potter realm when you step into it. You wait in line to order, get your food, and then get seated. The food was pretty good and reasonably priced. We had the fish and chips and turkey leg. If you're looking for a filling meal I would suggest the turkey leg, but it is quite messy.
We enjoyed a wonderful meal at the Three Broomsticks, reasonably priced with good portion size! I literally couldn't have asked for more than sitting in the sunshine, with a plate full of nice food, in front of Hogwarts!! A dream.
We had 6 adults so bought the Family Four Feast-rotisserie chicken, spare ribs, corn on cob, fresh steamed vegetables, Rosemary potatoes, fresh garden salad and bread. We added 2 orders of Fish & Chips(to die for). Had food leftover. Wonderful service. Their tea is brewed fresh with filtered, not Florida, water. With drinks and 3 beers, $125. Sure would have liked free refills on tea! Great atmosphere! Do not miss!
Breakfast is a bit extortionate. $16.99 for a plate of melon with a scone and a croissant. The fruit was nice, as was the scone however just not worth the money. The decor of the pub is great and is exactly how you'd expect it to look however some of the staff could work on being a little friendlier and more attentive when taking orders.
Even if you don't get anything there, just walk in! Its worth a visit! It is a great place to relax and take more pictures.
We went to Three Broomsticks for dinner and for breakfast. Everything we had was delicious! There were a lot of options to choose from and everyone found something they liked. I was able to substitute my side at breakfast which I really appreciated! Most restaurants like this won't do that without it being an issue. I loved the decor, it really had the Harry Potter feel I was looking for! Of the 2 Harry Potter themed restaurants at Universal, Three Broomsticks is the best!! We will definitely be back again.
If you like a big meal and value for your buck, Three Broomsticks is the place to go. We got the ribs and chicken on our Universal quick service dining plan and were astounded at getting a rack of 4-5 pork ribs, a full leg and thigh chicken portion, a side of potatoes and other side to go with the drink. We did not go away hungry, which is good or bad depending upon with amusement ride you wish to ride. And the atmosphere of an old pub is charming despite its cafeteria setup. The drawback to the Three Broomsticks is that the food is very institutional. There was little unique about the flavors and the ribs seemed almost to be the kind you get frozen from a grocery store.I'm glad I ate here, but even more glad I had the meal plan because, otherwise, the price would have been too steep. 
Had a great lunch at the Three Broomsticks, at first we were a little intimidated with the line going on outside but it moves quickly. It was 1 pm the heat was on outside but once you enter its nice and cool, if you prefer outdoor seating area it's available as well. Make sure to look up once you enter, they did a wonderful job at attention to detail it is truly magical. If you want a bang for your buck meal I strongly recommend the rotisserie chicken with roasted potatoes and corn on the cob. It is a reasonable portion and very tasty, honestly the fish and chips plate was disappointing. GO WITH THE CHICKEN, also you can have fun with your drink they have a wide variety all harry potter themed. (HINT: don't buy bottled water, unless you really want to, otherwise you can ask for a cup of water for free when you pick up your meal.
"A good selection of gluten free options. Speak to a chef before ordering to identify the gluten free options and to request some non-gf items to be modified to make them GF. Very fun wizardly tavern atmosphere and you can't miss the GF Butter Beer. I prefer the ""cold"" versus the ""frozen"" since you taste the creamy buttery top better with every sip!"
Although the restaurant was very crowded, everything seemed to be well organized. Good food, reasonable prices, nice and rather quiet seating on the outside behind the restaurant.
I ordered a plate of three meat pasties which came with a salad for $9.99 and was a bit disappointed. The pasties were delicious but small and I gobbled them in a flash. The salad was a basic iceberg lettuce with Ken's dressing in a package...meh...The room, however, definitely transports the visitor to the Wizarding universe.
Wanted to love it, but the food was awful, simply glopped onto a plate by disinterested servers, and the tables and floor were sticky and felt unclean. Granted, they churn a lot of bodies through this restaurant during a work day, and syrup and greasy floppy bacon are #1 on the menu, so it's probably hard to keep up with. Nearly $30 for two small cups of milk, and two small breakfast trays of stuff an Army cook would recoil at. However, it IS in Potter world, and was interesting to look at. If you don't want to eat, you can go in and just have a look and leave. 
Had breakfast here after a preliminary walk around and rides. I had fruit plate with blueberry scone. Very good. Detail in building amazing. 
You just have to go here. Use the early admission to Harry Potter; see Hogwarts Castle twice and end up here for breakfast. All meals cost the same ($17.99) so it's not an inexpensive breakfast for sure. But the atmosphere was terrific, the servers were alot of fun to talk to, and the food was pretty good -- eggs, bacon, sausage, scones etc... A hearty way to begin your day in Hogsmeade and really glad we went as it was a fun experience.
We were at Harry Potter and decided to have lunch. There were 6 of us. 2 Adults and 4 kids. We decided on the The great Feast which is a food platter for 4. It includes Chicken, Corn on the Cobb and vegetables, potatoes. ! child ordered fish and chips. We ate until full and there was still food left. This was definitely a good bargain for the park. There are no to go boxes so we had to leave the leftovers there. We will eat here again when in the park.
"You spend quite a bit on the food in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, and the food especially at this location is sub-par at best. Their breakfast for one person cost nearly $15 a person, and lunch and dinner isn't much better. For lunch I had the chicken and corn and potatoes. The potatoes were good, seasoned well, but the chicken was so dry I swear I was chewing on a piece of paper, and there was little to no flavor in it at all. The corn was also over cooked, and wasn't really something I would have spent my money on. Would rather eat at a different restaurant outside of Harry Potter area. Employees have a ""order and go"" attitude as well, willing to try again in the future, but the prices for the quality is not really worth it."
The place is beautifully decorated and cool!! A must see. We had a late breakfast at 10am and walked right in to just a few minutes wait. The continental breakfast was a nice change from what is offered most places and my daughter and I enjoyed the fruit and breads. The scone was as English as I have had in the US. The kids pancake was a perfect size. It was a nice cool place to sit as well. The seating area outback is nice too. 
It everything I imagined it would be it was extremely amazed and filled with joy I felt like crying in happiness because loving Harry Potter I always dreamed of going everywhere Harry Ron and Hermione went 
We had breakfast at both the Three Broomsticks and the Leaky Cauldron. This was the best option and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. The ambiance is great, you can have a nice leisurely breakfast while you listen to the sounds that are happening upstairs. I had the continental breakfast and my boyfriend had the English breakfast. It is on the expensive side but the portions are very large. They also have a good selection of the HP drinks. We got to the park early to go on the rides and look in the stores. Once we were done with that we headed over to the Three Broomsticks for breakfast. I definitely think that is the way to do before before it becomes packed.
We ate in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter every day we were there. Three Broomsticks is a restaurant in a theme park. So the lines can be long and it has a bit of a cattle call feel. BUT, they have done a great job of making up for it. The food was great, best lemonade ever, and we even forgot that is was a huge theme park restaurant. 
"Here you are definitely paying to eat at a ""theme restarunt"". My chicken was very dry, and my daughters ribs were overlooked too. It looked like they were mass prepaired in a kitchen somewhere else and just reheated there. Not very tasty. The up side is the staff help get seating, so you don't have to wander around."
The Harry Potter fan will love decor. The food portion size is large and the taste is good. I enjoyed my meal but there are better options at Universal.
If you love Harry Potter, this is the place to go. Actually, even if you don't love him, give it a try, you won't be disappointed. We went for breakfast and dinner and in my opinion, the breakfast was the better food, and better value! 
We were not impressed with the food. The Fish and Chips were decent, the ribs and chicken were a bit dry and tasteless, but the sides were good. My favorite was the corn on the cob. We chose to have the butterbeer outside from the cart, which is Frozen Butterbeer. That was delicious!
Really fun to interact with the servers who can speak Potterspeak! I like that they have Newcastle Ale but the food is good too. In hot weather it is really cool in here! I liked going here for my time outs when I got overwhelmed with crowds. I could sit there and people watch and take pictures of the stuff on the walls. Relaxing for me.
I'm a die-hard HP fan, so eating at the Three Broomsticks was pretty cool. The set up is kind of confusing, and by the looks of the line it seemed like it would take forever since it was 1 pm, however it wasn't a bad wait. We shared the shepard's pie meal which included salad, and added a side of garlic roasted potatoes and a butterbeer, coming out to around 24 dollars I think? I had bariatric surgery so I can't eat a lot, so feeding 2 people is easier than usual for us. My favorite was the roasted potatoes, very flavorful. The shepard's pie was OK (better than chicken strips or a hot dog). We had a good time!
Great food! A perfect place to have lunch, especially on those hot Florida days. Kids will love it, you really feel like your in the movie. 
"If you are a Harry Potter Fan, this is a 'Must Due' (Same with The Leaky Cauldron) I think they did a great job with the decor and with the food items. (If you are wondering, The Leaky Cauldron is very similar, but they defined the difference between Scotland and England - Shepherds pie vs Cottage pie, ect) I like the seating here better then at the Leaky Cauldron (I am not fan of the Family Style seating there) Here you can have a nice private table. The decor is great, it's fun to look around, and look up, as you eat because there is ""magic"" going on all around. This is also a great stop for breakfast if you are an annual passholder or are staying at an on site hotel, because this area is open early for those guests, so it's quite nice to be able to be there before the crowds roll in."
Come in and get some HOT butterbeer - it is amazing, even better than the cold stuff!Look up and around - the architecture is very cool. Food is trying to be English Pub fare; it's OK, you would never go out of your way to eat here just for the food. Much better dining at the entryway to the park. But worth a peek inside, and just get some HOT butterbeer - you'll thank me!
We had a wonderful breakfast, and made a point to come back a 2nd time before our trip ended. The food was good and you get plenty of it. 
With our package we got a breakfast at Three Broomsticks. There are a number of choices including English breakfast, American breakfast ( bacon, eggs etc.), pancakes, fruit etc. For mass produced food, it really was quite decent and for around $13-15 per breakfast, not out of line with other offerings. and the Potter atmosphere appealed to my boys.
Attention to detail and lovely interiors makes the whole harry potter experience come to life!. My kids were super thrilled to eat here and they have fast service and good food. Definitely try butter beer!
Nice food, fresh tasting, good breakfast and nicely done theming.Good place to grab a bit to keep your energy up before more Wizarding wonderful memories are made!
We were able to have breakfast at Three Broomsticks. What a fun experience. The food was tasty and the decor was really a treat.
This one a good pick by one of the members of staff. We got the full platter pumpkin juice and the apple pie, oh my life it good worth every cent and the customer service was great no wonder the queue was long. We lined up for a while not to long, but our food did take a while, it was odd how they gave us our pudding first but then again it was busy. 
Dashed in as young son having withdrawal symptoms from British fish and chips! Pleasantly surprised not to be disappointed with fish to a good standard I went for rib platter which was pretty generous and corn cob tasty. Although there was a queue we didn't wait too long and queue management and help to find you a table was super efficient 
This is a unique restaurant located near the dragon challenge coasters at Islands of Adventure. I believe they serve breakfast, but we have always gone for lunch and enjoy it. It's a bit overpriced but we've never been disappointed with the quality of food. I get the half chicken and ribs platter which are tasty, but I have to say my favorite part of the meal is the grilled corn. I would go early as it backs up very quickly. Once you've ordered, the food comes out fairly quickly, but the line to order is slow moving and it may be difficult to find a seat. Very casual for lunch after a morning at Harry Potter world.
Visited this restaurant in April during the holidays when going to universal studios, Harry Potter world. When me and my family first walked in the atmosphere was AMAZING and very effective (just like the film) we waited in line for around 20mins which was a little disappointing and had to wait a long time for our food to come, which was very expensive but worth every penny. The staff were very friendly and apologetic about the wait for the food, I would definitely recommend this place for families and just generally having lunch!! 
"We decided to eat here because it was unique and the reviews I read were pretty favorable. We had the feast for 4 and my son had the fish. The feast was pretty good overall. We all really liked the potatoes. The Chicken and ribs were good too and the corn on the cob. Overall, that food was good but nothing spectacular. The butterbeer was fine, but no one thought it worth the $6.99 price tag. We all liked the frozen butterbeer the best. Other than the cream at the top, it tasted like a different flavor of soda to me--nothing special, so I'm not sure what the fuss is all about (and yes, I'm a fan of Harry Potter). I prefer Cream Soda over Butter beer. Overall, my family enjoyed the meal. The reason I give it 3 stars is because the wait was the longest line we stood in at the park (it took about 45 minutes for us to be able to order). You start outside and think, ""Oh, this isn't too bad."" But then you go inside and realize there is a much longer line inside the building. The cost was pretty high, though average for your typical park food. And the food was honestly average, nothing spectacular."
I was a little shocked because I think the merchandise at Universal is more reasonably priced than Disney so I thought this might be as well. I was wrong. To start you wait outside in a line, then you think you are ready to order. Wrong. Then you wait in another line inside. Then you wait in line to order. Then you wait in another line to pick up the food, then another line to get a table. The food taste is okay, not something I would crave or like my mom says, write home about. The prices are super expensive! A large family would go broke eating lunch here! The butterbeer is yum, but expensive. :(. 
We always grab a bite to eat in one of the Harry Potter restaurants. I prefer the Leaky Cauldron for the atmosphere differences. They have the same menus so it is just a personal preference as to which is better. We start out in Islands of Adventure, spend time in Hogsmeade, jump on the Hogwart's Express, arrive in London, head to Diagon Alley (through the broken wall), eat at Leaky Cauldron, and continue exploring. Be sure to locate all of the hidden places in Diagon Alley!
The food is pretty good and the selection is right on what you would imagine for a British pub. Staff is helpful and quick. The place is a little dirty (sticky tables and floor in places), but that is how I imagined it in from the books. I loved eating in there - the atmosphere was perfect, even down to the moving Boar's head behind the bar. Charming! Food is on the blnad side, like everything at the theme parks, but still good.
Wrong company, I know, but the wall of antlers was interesting. The food here was amazing. My sister had the fish and chips and I had the shephard's pie and salad. I loved the shephard's pie, and my sister said that the fish and chips were among some of the best she's ever had. The Three Broomsticks definitely beat out the meals we had at the Leaky Cauldron (Traditional Breakfast) and the Krusty Burger (Krusty Burger and Curly Fries). I like the look inside and feels like it does a good job of staying true to what you might expect inside the Three Broomsticks from the books. I think the Leaky Cauldron does a better job of it, but it's still amazing. The restaurant is connected to the Hog's Head Pub, so it was a bit weird to be inside the Three Broomsticks and hear the hog snorting, but it's a small detail and not a big deal.
Eggs were cold, potatoes were delicious, the rest was middling. The menu for lunch looked GREAT (as well as the food that was almost ready.)
It was nice to get a chance to eat in Hogsmeade. The food isn't for everyone and they don't have much of a selection but it is worth going in for Sheppard's pie and enjoy the ambiance. It isn't an actual restaurant style more so a cafeteria style experience to grab a quick bite and sit.
A great place to take family in Universal Studios. The family feast is a perfect meal for a hungry muggle family!
As with most of the Harry Potter attractions at Universal, the look of this place is excellent, if surprisingly spartan. I would have expected to see it populated by some characters from the series, but instead it's a very open, if medieval-looking space that can accommodate many customers. We shared the cornish pasties and side salad for $10. I thought that was a good price until we got the food: each of the three pasties (meat pies) was about the size of an old dollar coin. Still, the meal--with butterbeer--was refreshing and tasted good. The back terrace is a great seating option if you want some fresh air.
this was included in the Harry Potter package ,had the pancake breakfast with bacon 7 sausage and it was really good, so much better than the Leaky Cauldron.
Best food in the park! Something for everyone's tastes and super kid-friendly! Great value, too! They don't serve soft-drinks in the restaurant, but they do serve Butterbeer, a variety of teas, and lemonade and water. Highly recommend arriving by 9:00 am for breakfast and then eating your breakfast on the patio in the back of the restaurant. It's so peaceful and you get a beautiful view of Hogwarts Castle. 
The ribs and battered fish were both good, but they were a little cold. The line was long, but that is to be expected (good food). The corn and fries were good as well. The waster was fine (not like unfiltered Orlando water). 
If you are a Potter Fan, do not miss this for lunch. Very good food at a great price, and large quantities. They move people in and out very fast...although I would recommend going before 12:15. They are courteous...kind and helpful.
"While in Islands of Adventure, we ate lunch at the Three Broomsticks. While the theme of the place has an appeal, I found the ""flow"" of the restaurant rather frustrating as you stand in line forever, go to collect your tray, battle everyone else rushing with their trays to collect condiments etc and the STAND IN LINE AWAITING A TABLE while your outrageously overpriced and mediocre lunch grows cold.Once you are crammed into an available seat, get cozy with the other strangers huddled about your table and do not plan to carry on any conversation with your table mates. Between the general din of the overcrowded restaurant and the non stop audio track played to give the effect of being in a dark, dreary and apparently haunted bar, you won't be able to hear a thing.This was my least favourite restaurant experience in the park thus far. I will make a pass and visit other less annoying venues on future visits.As for the food? Mediochre at best. Perhaps I could be kinder if my hot meal had been acceptably warm by the time I got to sit and eat it."
This is my favorite between the two Wizarding World restaurants. The theming for Three Broomsticks is Amazing. The attention to detail is really exquisite - it felt like I had walked into the pages of the novel. Better yet the prices here are extremely reasonable for theme park food. The food variety is really nice and deviates from the standard theme park menu. My husband and I ate here multiple times during our honeymoon and we tried the Cornish Pasties, Chicken and Ribs platter and Smoked Turkey leg over different occasions. We also had our butter beer fix here, including the butter beer soft serve ice cream. Little tip - if you dine a little earlier than the lunch crowd (around 11am), the lines are really quite manageable. We managed to get our food within 10 minutes (although admittedly, we visited on a low peak day). It's also a great place to get butter beer without having to contend with the neverending lines outdoors. The Cornish Pasties are rather small and are better for small eaters. I didnt particularly like them as they somehow reminded me of microwaveable food. The accompanying salad was quite yummy though. The turkey leg is of a pretty standard park variety, just served with fries in a nice setting. For me, the standout was the chicken and ribs platter. I just wish it came with more sauce. Still, the meat was tender and this dish is pretty fairly priced for the amount of food you get. Easily shareable for smaller eaters! On the whole, this is more than decent quick service fare within a phenomenal atmosphere. I'd definitely recommend eating here just for the experience.
A great inn to check out if you want the true HP experience. Felt very realistic complete with a silly animated hogs head behind the bar. This restaurant has a nice outdoor seating area in which you overlook the water and a bit of the park. Good prices for drinks;I had a Strongbow Cider (because I’m more of a cider gal than a beer drinker most of the time) and my husband ordered a Hogsmead Ale. The beer was an amber sort of beer and was really good, thought wish it was served in something besides plastic (but you can take it with you ) . All in all, the beer prices were decent and the atmosphere was magical enough to definitely warrant a repeat visit on our next time to WWOHP.
This is located in Hogsmeade Village. They have an excellent breakfast menu that is decently priced for the amount of food you get. There are several different combos that include a mix of pancakes, porridge, sausage, bacon, potatoes, eggs, toast, and fresh fruit. They do offer a lighter, healthier option as well. Lunch here was good, but breakfast is much better. We prefer to have breakfast at the Three Broomsticks and lunch at the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley. 
We stopped by the Three Broomsticks after a long day at Universal. It was about an hour before the park was scheduled to close. Unfortunately, the Three Broomsticks was already shutting down. We stood in line for 20 minutes, but the line didn't move. Instead of serving food cafeteria-style so they can get a lot of people served quickly, they were taking orders at the front of the line and then bringing it out to people. However, their system didn't work, and no one was getting served. Universal should close down the Three Broomsticks and revamp it so that it works for families trying to get in and out for dinner.
We took the kids here for breakfast - they loved it.The food was just OK, service was speedy and efficient but what the kids most loved was the atmosphere - completely immersed in Harry Potter. Of course they tried and loved the butter beer (I did not). Prices are high - what one would expect in the park.
Very hearty and tasty breakfast, perfect for sitting down and relaxing after waiting in lines at Harry Potter. Try the English breakfast to taste the black pudding. 
The food is pub style, which is a nice change from the hamburger choices at most of the other restaurants. The decor is amazing. The butterbeer is yummy.
We went here twice during our stay at Island of Adventures. Both times it was for breakfast. I found that the breakfast here was very simple but hearty. They had enough variety to not complicate things to much. They also offered butter beer and pumpkin juice with your meal which was great. We were there during slow times so we were allowed to sit wherever we wanted. For a theme park restaurant it is great!
This is a must-stop for my family at Harry Potter Land. As they don't take reservations, wait times will vary depending on the time of year and day; weekends are usually busy during popular times. The family feast is very good and includes salad, ribs, chicken, corn on the cob, and potatoes. The price is reasonable for theme parks. Drinks are limited to lemonade, iced tea, butter beer (pumpkin juice); no sodas. We do not like the special drinks and stick with iced tea. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Once you have received your food you are escorted to an open table, thus you don't have to stand with your tray hoping someone will get up. The atmosphere is inline with the Harry Potter universe.
Cold, uninspired food. Really only one choice for non-meat eaters - porridge. Most expensive oatmeal ever.
We ate here for lunch while in the Wizading World of Harry Potter. It was a little long of a line but it was worth the wait, plus no longer then any other restaurant in the park. I got the turkey leg and it was great! Definitely big enough to share. We also tried the pumpkin soda which was good but not worth the almost $5 price tag. Also don't get bottled water just ask for the free tap water :) 
As theme park eateries go, you get pretty huge portions for what you pay. Service was good. You order at a counter and then staff directs you to a table. We ate inside but they also have patio seating. Our lunch consisted of baked half chicken, shepherd's pie, and fish-n-chips. Big portions and pretty good for pre-prepared grub. The frozen Butter Beer is to die for. Get there early or late as the lunch line gets very, very long. We arrived around 11:15 and waited barely 5 minutes to order.
We ate at both the Leaky Cauldron and Three Broomsticks - they were both great. Since they are in two different parks at Universal they are easily visited. The wait was brief, the selection good, the service excellent. At both restaurants the staff finds you a place to set, which eliminates the hassle encountered at other parks (especially Magic Kingdom). The decor is pure Harry Potter, and even if you aren't a fan, you will be intrigued. Food was good and the price reasonable.
We had initial reservations about queuing for a quick service meal, but credit to the staff, it was really efficient. The food was good, but not great. Drinks were a bit over priced, but you have to have butter beer. The theming is excellent and if you are visiting diagon alley you have to eat here. 
We stopped for lunch at the 3 Broomsticks and were disappointed with the food offerings compared to the other Harry Potter themed restaurant in the other Universal park. Don't try the Cornish Pasty dish as the so-called pasties are hardly bigger than a canape. If I had not ordered the roast potatoes as a side dish I would have left still feeling hungry.
"We were about to feed 2 adults and 4 kids with one of their feast platters for 4. Rotisserie chicken, ribs, potatoes, veggies and salad family style and so good! Use the bathroom outside to hear the ghost ""Moaning Myrtle"""
"The food was pretty good, service quick and the atmosphere was true to the Harry Potter experience.The price, for what you get, is typical for eating in the park. We tried the ""famous butter beer""; but given the price would skip it in the future!"
we entered at 11:30am, and there was already a line, but it moved pretty quickly. The menu is limited, and you are assigned a cashier, then go to a station with the same number to pick up your food. Once you pick it up, a hostess brings you to a table. As everything at universal, it is well-run, especially on a lightly attended day. I had the smoked, rotisserie chicken. It was a substantial amount of chicken, and very delicious. It comes with corn and potatoes. I asked if I could substitute a salad for the potatoes and was told yes. But when I got the meal was told that the salad counts as two sides. Weird. My husband had the fish and chips, which he enjoyed, though I have to say the chip portion was pretty meager. Of course, the decor was the star. Amazing, and worthwhile just to go in and take a peek even if you don't eat there.
Had the Cornish Pasties. They were good, three small meat & veggie filled pastries. They came with a salad & it was a perfect light lunch. We also tried to strawberry peanut butter ice cream, which was odd but good. Kind of like a PB&J sandwich! The chocolate trifle was AMAZING! It was chocolate cake & mouse with strawberries & whip cream. Small, but absolutely delicious. I absolutely love eating at the Harry Potter themed restaurants. It's a great break away from the traditional chicken fingers, burgers & pizza in the rest of the park. Always add on a butterbeer!!
We loved the food here, yes it's a bit pricey but very good. We got the platter for 4 and it was more than enough. The chicken and ribs were moist and cooked to perfection. The corn and veggies were a hit , the potatoes had a bit to much rosemary for my liking but still very good. A platter of 4 , with 4 drinks was close a $100 bucks. It's worth it for the experience. The dining is a bit cramped but like I said fun and worth it.
Having a meal at the three broomsticks or at the leaky cauldron is definitely a must do if you are visiting HP Wizarding World, the scenery is just perfect, you really feel that your are inside a HP movie. Prices are a bit over the average cost of a meal in Orlando, pretty acceptable considering you are inside an amusement park, but is worth it. While you are there do not forget to ask for a butter beer, and take a walk around the restaurant, both inside and outside, it has a nice terrace with a great view of Hogwarts Castle. Although the best pictures from the castle can be taken from the bridge that connects Jurassic Park's world with Hogwarts.
We enjoyed our dinner here! We had fish n chips and the chicken and rib platter. Both were good. I only wish the drink had more options on size or a refill line. We were tired and thirsty. Didn't want to get back in the huge line for another dink. The theme was so fun and the staff very friendly. 
Nothing really special about the food. I got the fish and chips and it reminded me of Long John Silvers taste and texture. The fries were wedge cut and very good. Added and corn on the cob and I must say that was the best part of the meal. Very tender and flavorful. The environment of the dining hall is awesome with great attention to detail. 
If you hAve the meal plan the is a great deal, it's considered a quick service meal. The ribs literally fall off the bone, the potatoes are delecious and the corn on the cob was a real treat. Beyond the fabulous food was the ambiance it was like we were in the movie. So much fun!
We arrived before the big crush for lunch. If you want to beat the crowd come by 11:15 AM for lunch. My friend and I both had the Cornish pasties and salad. Three very small pasties (really more of a tiny empanada) with ground beef. If you like true English Cornish pasties you will be disappointed. There's was not enough dressing for the salad.My other friend had a chicken and corn on the cob. She said the corn was good. It was an entire half of a chicken roasted. The frozen butter beer is delicious.The decor is fun. Lots of antlers one the walls.You come into the area and they assign you to a chasier. You choose your meal and then go to a line to pick up your m,eat. The three of us were assigned to three different lines and two of us were waiting for our third friend for 15 minutes to get a table together. 
You order your meal at the counter, find a place to sit, and it is brought to you. We went on a cold day and enjoyed hot butter beer. The place is unique because it is in the world of Harry Potter. The British Breakfast is really good. The sausage are the best thing on the plate.
Lunch for 2 was nearly $60. Corn on the cob was $3.75 each. If you have difficulty getting up from low chairs this place is NOT for you. All chairs are at the correct height for a second grader. My chicken salad should have been called BONE in Chicken salad as I bit into 2 separate bone fragments. The chicken salad was about $15, roughly the same price at other venues around the park but the chicken salad that I had the day before was nearly 3 times bigger for the same price. 
This restaurant has plenty of space for larger groups. Bar has good selection of adult beverages. Fast service and a great place for a break.
Had a wonderful breakfast here but kept going back all day for more butter beer. Great choice of food and the atmosphere and service was great. 
This is such a cool experience. We loved looking around the entire area. We ate the fish and chips which arrived hot and fresh. We also enjoyed the Pumpkin juice, very cute touch. The tables were clean and the staff was very friendly.
nice to have a choice of pub fare other than the typical junk food provided in the rest of the park. 
If you love Harry Potter you will surely want to eat at either The Three Broomsticks or The Leaky Cauldron. As far as we could tell the menus were the same but the decor and atmosphere were different so why not try them both?! We had breakfast and the portions were generous and filling. The Traditional English Breakfast will fill you up and was quite good. Kids got the Pancake breakfast and were also satisfied. True aficionados (and the kids) will probably want the Hot Butterbeer but they have coffee and OJ for the less adventurous. The far side of the restaurant features the Hogs Head Tavern with the actual moving Hog Head so make sure you check that out. Lots of movie and book details to be seen though out so make sure you check it out even if you choose to sit outside. All in all a 2 Thumbs up!
I rate the Barbecue chicken and the fish as very good. The pork barbecue was average. The vegetables were Great!!
Just like the Leaky Cauldron, this restaurant is more about the theming and immersion into the Wizarding World of Harry Potter than it is about the food itself. Don't get me wrong, the food was alright (though the chicken was dry), but it was neat to just sit there and take in all the little details. The frozen butter beer was delicious, definitely recommend that over the non-frozen version.
We had a nice breakfast here as part of the Harry Potter package. The food was freshly prepared and quite tasty. 
I recently had a chance to visit Universal for a day and my first stop was the Three Broom Sticks for a Long Island icetea (raspberry ice tea) and to sit out on the back patio and enjoy the view of the castle. It is so beautiful and peaceful out there. The view is great and the drinks from the bar are amazing. I make this a must do on all my trips to Universal.
Fun quick service restaurant to visit when in Islands of Adventure/Hogsmeade. The fish and chips were very good and had a good traditional pub menu. They let me order off of the kids menu which was nice. Has a nice outdoor seating area in the back with a cool view of the castle. 
Breakfast was included in our vacation package. Since it was included I wasn't expecting anything great but it was actually very good. There were 3 adults and 2 children. Everyone enjoyed their food, it came out hot and fresh, not like it had been sitting forever. Everyone had plenty to eat and the atmosphere couldn't be beat! Just like in the movies.
This place was a great option to pop into quickly for lunch. Their food was pretty impressive! The fish and chips were good, as was their chicken and corn on the cob. The restaurant is just amazing and I really felt like I was in the movie sitting there for lunch. It was really special. I would recommend popping in to at least just sit down and have that experience.
We really enjoyed our lunch here, the food was mostly delicious and the decor was incredible! The menu was 'pub grub' and I quite enjoyed the fish and chips. The staff were very friendly.
So excited to be back in the Wizarding World and to eat the best fish & chips I had ever tasted, so was quite disappointed at our super salty meal when we started eating. I don't know if it was just an off day in the kitchen? Someone spilled salt into the batter? But the fish was like eating salted cod! Could not finish beyond a few bites, even after peeling off the batter. The other meal of chicken and potatoes was done well, but very disappointed with the fish. Made me not want to even try the food at the Leaky Cauldron in the other park. So we just drank lots of Butterbeer, lol! 
"The three broomsticks delivers authenticity just like every other aspect of HP World!! The interior's architecture is beautiful, designed with a grand interior with old reclaimed wood and perfect period lighting. The food is geared nicely towards an American palette while still feeling ""Old World"". Anyone can order a child's portion and it is very filling."
Breakfast was really good compared to other options in the park. Real expensive. The fan in me loved it but once was enough. Better off getting something before going into the park.  Whatch out for birds.
Had lunch here with my teenage son and the food was surprising good. Kind of cool as well as we are HP nerds.
"Visited the Three Broomsticks for lunch and dinner. For lunch I had the fish and chips. Having been to England many times, I will say that the fish and chips here would make any vendor in England proud. For dinner, we had the family platter which consisted of a salad to start then the entree of chicken, spare ribs, vegetables , potatoes and corn on the cob. There was enough to fed a family of 4 and if you left hungry, it was your own fault. The food was great and the atmosphere was like being in the Harry Potter world. You didn't have anything from the ""outside"" world like coke or pepsi to choose from. All the items on the menu were specific to the Harry Potter world to help keep the immersion intact. Highly recommend this restaurant if you want to fully experience the World of Harry Potter."
Just another great place to eat in the parks. A must see!! Food was lovely with fast friendly service (because it's a nice quiet time to visit in Feb). Not overpriced and has fantastic features to really put you in the movies!!
The food here is a better deal than most quick-service places, and the ambiance makes it worth visiting. While you may be playing close to $10-15 per plate, you get quite a bit of food. I ordered the rotisserie 'half chicken' that comes with corn on the cob and fried potatoes, and paid $14. The chicken itself, while juicy and seasoned on the exterior, was rather bland on the inside. The potatoes were seasoned well, though not to my pallet, and the corn was pretty good. Girlfriend said that the fish and chips were really good as well.The only downsides that I have to this place are: cleanliness, speed, and table height. Because the place always seems packed, there can be quite a line once you are already 'checked-in' inside the door. From there you are pointed to a counter where you put your order in. The person at the register then points you to another counter where you pick up your food. You can then take your tray to get your utensils/napkins/condiments, and another worker will find you an open seat.After you are done eating, your table will quickly be put back into service for the next guests to eat. It's at this time that I worry about the cleanliness of this place. The seating is relatively cramped, which leads me to believe that cleaning around everything can't be easy, thus leading to a not-so-clean environment.Final downside is with the theme of the restaurant. Although the place looks great, some of the chairs sit much lower than a normal chair would, so you end up eating with your plate mid-chest instead of near your stomach.
Nice outside patio view of hogwarts castle. Had breakfast with the meal deal for our stay. Reasonable for park pricing, I had bacon eggs toast sausage. Full! Friend had pastery with fruit good, not as filling.
The environment and decor is very cute and immersive! We went here for breakfast, so I can only speak for their breakfast menu. Unfortunately, the food is just not that great and is very overpriced for the amount you actually get, which is typical for a theme park. If you are going to try the butterbeer, you have to get it hot- it's the best! 
For the cost you don't get much and I found their fish and chips too greasy, too much breading, too little fish, and not much for the price. The atmosphere is good, but the food pales in comparison to this park's other restaurants in my opinion. 2.4/ 5.
We ate here for breakfast. It was okay, but we liked the Leaky Cauldron better. The layout here seems too crunched and everyone is scrunched together. The food was okay as well, but nothing special. You pay for the atmosphere.
"Food was extremely bland and micro-portions for a stiff price. Menu is misleading, looks very tempting, but we felt it was bait and switch. Items are described beautifully and are alluring, but if they offered a picture of what they actually served, you'd ""just keep walking""."
Food was good and lots of it. The feast had something for everyone. Even the 2 year old loved the corn on the cob.
First, I think if you are going here,you have to have some knowledge or affection to Harry Potter. If not, please just stop reading the restaurant isn't right for you. I truly enjoy this restaurant, primarily because I enjoy the food and I enjoy the theme. Not many people like English food (in fact it's notoriously bad!) but I sincerely think it gets a bad rep. Universal knows they have to appeal to the masses, so I think they struck a good balance here. The only reason I tacked off a bubble because it can be a long wait. 
So over the course of our stay we ate here a few times so obviously it wasn't horrible. They were very good about the gluten allergy that we had in the party, though sometimes that didn't make it up to the cooks. So we had to wait while it was remade. The first day I had the Cornish pasties, three small pasties and a salad. For $10 it's not horrible but definitely the pasties could be bigger. For breakfast I had the traditional English and it was quite good the tomatoes were nicely seasoned so was the blood pudding. They also did an amazing job decorating this building it really does transport you to hogsmeade and the three broomsticks
The experience of eating at the three broomsticks is nearly enough really! We had a late breakfast/early lunch here on our second park day and although i wasn't feeling well from riding The forbidden journey on an empty stomach still enjoyed this meal. We sat outside behind the restaurant and it was a lovely view over Islands of adventure, i felt i could have sat there all day. I had shepherds pie with salad and my partner had ribs I think and we both really enjoyed our meals and the experience!
This place seemed very busy to me but i was advised actually it was a slow day as crowds were not lied out the door . we did have to wait in line for 10 mins but they fulfilled our order with military precision . They have servers reserving tables and guiding people with food to site down . So be aware no open seating in here you have to work with the seaters . Also no soda available only juices and flavored drinks . the fish and chips blew me away cooked really well in an authentic batter , a definite must try . the chips were really potato wedges though
"Loved eating at the Three Broomsticks, I had the Rotisserie Smoked Chicken Platter served with roasted corn and roasted potatoes, my hubby had the Chicken and Ribs Platter served with roasted corn and roasted potatoes and my daughter had the fish and chips- all was great tasting, was better then ordinary ""amusement park"" foods- I recommend the Frozen Butter beer, so Yummy!@! its worth the couple extra $$ to purchase the plastic Butter Beer Cup and use it all day long for refills, you can refill soda, tea and lemonade super cheap, and we asked for a free refill before we left the Three Broomsticks . You can relax inside away from the ""heavy traffic"" of people. The environment is totally what you would expect to see from the books- place was not crowded around 1pm for lunch- great place to unwind.We really enjoyed our 3 days at Universal and we will definitely plan another trip here. "
"Three Broomsticks was on our ""must do"" list and we were not disappointed. You get a good value for your money. The Fish and Chips are amazing and also the Rips Platter. "
We just barely beat the lunch rush and placed our order very quickly- The feast- takes about 20 mins to prepare- was a huge amount of food & very tasty. If you forgot to order a beverage, it was easy to pop over to the hogshead and get one. The environment looked as we would picture it from the movies
Loved eating here. It was part of my hotel package. I got a breakfast included. The food was very good, You order your food at the register and they bring it out to your table. The lady who brought out my food was very nice, she even told me about the outdoor seating area that not many people knew about. She told me it had a fantastic view of the castle!
We weren't expecting great food, but went for the experience of eating in the Three Broomsticks, which didn't disappoint this family of Harry Potter fanatics. If you're looking for high quality food and a full-service meal in the park, step just outside HP world and go to Mythos in the Islands park for lunch instead. Otherwise, enjoy the awesome HP atmosphere here and know the food is just so-so.
The food was average and they struggled to handle our food allergies (peanut and tree nuts). The interior is designed nicely, but it does not make the food taste better.
My family of four (very picky eaters) stopped by for lunch during a recent park visit. Being a big Harry Potter fan, I recommend walking through the restaurant and checking out the details. Then head out back and have your meal next to the water and if you're lucky the big round table with a private area will be open! We ordered the platter and it was more than enough for all of us. With four drinks and the platter, it cost less than half of any meal at another park nearby. Great value - delicious food - unique atmosphere!
The portions are large but the chicken could be better cooked. It is very crowded on weekends. Good place to sit and eat. 
I was surprised at the wait in the Three Broomsticks. The line started out the door, went inside the restaurant, and continued for another 10-15 minutes of waiting. However, once we ordered our food, the whole process was very fast, and we received our food and were seated within a few minutes of ordering. I had fish & chips, and my daughter had chicken strips. Both were cooked well without being too greasy. I liked that iced tea was a drink option. It was worth trying once, but I would not make it a regular meal stop on future visits to Universal.
After waiting an hour and a half for the Incredible Hulk ride, my boyfriend and I were tired, hungry, and needed a break. We didn't want any of your typical theme park pizza/burgers/chicken tenders, so we decided to head to Three Broomsticks at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. For a table of two at around 2 pm, the host told us that the wait was about 25 minutes. But don't let this or the line outside the restaurant deter you. The line moves pretty quickly, and the wait was more like 15 minutes. Once you're inside, someone will direct you to a numbered register. You order your food, and then you wait at a separate counter, corresponding to that number in order to pick up your food. Then you go to the seating area and another hostess there will seat you. This system was great because it was really organized. It ensures that you actually have a table to sit at and you won't have to hover over people like a vulture jusy to grab a seat. This might be the one thing that Disney should take notes on.For my entree, I had the shepherd's pie, which comes with a garden salad. The pie looks small but it was actually pretty filling. I liked it more than I thought I would, even though I hate peas. My BF had the smoked turkey leg, which came with potato wedges. I hated the smokey flavor and how salty it was but he seemed to enjoy it. The potato wedges were good. We also ordered some butterbeer, and two beers: Dragon's Tail (reminds me of Magic Hat) and Hog's Mead (think Blue Point). Overall, I had a great experience so if I ever find myself back at Islands of Adventure, I wouldn't mind stopping here for lunch again.
In comparison to the rest of the food in the park that we have tried, I would say this is was, hands-down, the best. Between our party we had a kid's macaroni and cheese, kid's quarter chicken, chicken sandwich and soup/salad lunch combo. We were all really happy with our food! And in terms of price I didn't think it was half bad. Our four meals were about $45 including drinks,and they were huge plates. I loved that the kids meals came with healthy sides like raw veggies and grapes. We tried the butterbeer and pumpkin juice (because you HAVE to!). We liked both the drinks although they are quite sweet. Service is cafeteria style, but once seated the ambiance is pretty neat if you're a Harry Potter fan. If we ever go back to Universal Studios I would definitely eat here again. 
The way this location is set up, you order then crowd around (kids in tow) to wait for your name to be called, then be seated. Not recommended for those with small or tired kids!
Although the atmosphere is great, the food was NOT. Our package included breakfast here and it was quite disappointing. Scrambled eggs were downright NASTY and coffee was like brown water, the croissant was good and English bacon OK. Pancakes could have been a better option if they had been hot. Best looking plates we saw around us were the continental with fresh fruit, yogurt and croissant.
I did not go in. Just checked the menu posted outside. they don't have a lot of options accordin to me. On the plus side,there's a butterbeer van right outside that sells butterbeer OB-viously (Snape voice), gilly water (i think it's just water with that label) and pumpkin juice ( surprisingly tasty) 
And at about $22 per was a fair deal. Roasted chicken was superb with yummy broccoli and carrots , grilled tAters. Crumbly apple Tarts were really impressive. Order at the counter. Crowd swells at about 11:30 So get there a bit before. 
We knew that during our trip to the parks we absolutely had to eat at least one meal in the Harry Potter restaurants.  This was  our place of choice. You order at the counter and then proceed to the food counters to pick up your order. All of the staff are dressed in character, which makes the atmosphere great.  My son and I loved the fish and chips. Very tasty, the tartar sauce was exceptional. My husband got the chicken and rib combo with roasted potatoes, it was decent, but nothing extraordinary. In fact, he had said he liked the fish better than his food.  I will most definitely eat here again when visiting the parks.
We had early entry to Universal Studios and so did not have breakfast at the hotel as we did most days and thought we would have breakfast on the park. We knew it would be more expensive because you always have to pay more when you eat or drink in places like that but we did expect to get a good breakfast for it. We paid $72.38 which at the time of the exchange rate came out at £55.77 for 4 people to have a cooked breakfast and a drink. It really wasnt very nice at all, there have display plates of what you get for the different breakfasts and that looks really apetising but what you get is not the same and even my husband who will eat almost anything said it really was not good and left some (ok the rest of us had given him parts of ours as we just couldnt eat it because it tasted awful) but still. We were all hungry later and wish we had just gone to the supermarket the night before and brought something with us to eat to the park and maybe gone for just a drink instead as we would have of enjoyed it more.
Good food and a variety of good draft beers. Shepherd's pie and the family dish are very good. Also the ribs.
We chose to eat lunch at this restaurant while at Hogsmeade. It was set up well for serving lots of people with very little hassle. The food not remarkable but not bad either. Typical pricing for this type of venue.
The setting is different. Feels like you are in Harry Potter's world. The food is not the greatest but we eat there for the experience and not the food. The kids like the set up. We had breakfast there, it was ok. Nothing special, a bit overpriced. But since you are there, you might as well experience it all. The staff is friendly and helpful. You order your food, pay then go sit down. It was more of a self service restaurant.
For our visit to Three Broomsticks, we were able to benefit from the early Wizarding World entrance because we were staying on Universal property. This really does affect our review, because we had absolutely no wait time at all! We were by the front door in line as they opened the doors, making us the first customers! We were greeted warmly, and the staff turned into a well-oiled machine, getting customers in, orders taken, food prepared and seated in a timely manner. We really enjoyed the English options! And pumpkin juice! Yum. The food was hot, fresh and tasty! I almost wish the process had taken a bit longer so we could have stayed longer!I thought the price was a bit on the high side for breakfast (fixed price for adult and child), but you did get a rather large amount of food.The atmosphere is great! We loved looking around for hidden secrets, my daughter loved seeing the suitcases up the staircase and the maids trolley on the ceiling!We will definitely return to Three Broomsticks the next time we are at Universal Orlando!
It's quite cramped in here but we were in there at a busy time, you are sent to a till to pay, then you go to a server who then gives you your food and then you find another member of staff so that you can be seated at a table. I was a little annoyed that I could only get a Hogshead souvenir tankard if I also got a Hogsbrew beer as the beer was horrible, ended up tipping most of it away. We had wedges which came out on a small plate. The staff were great and everything but there was just so many people in there that we didn't stay long.
Great food and loved butterbeer! $65 for 3 people to eat, but portions were big. Very tasty meal. We bought 1 glass of butterbeer for the 3 of us to try. I don't think I could have had a glass for myself just because it is sweet. Loved the environment, very movie-like. Great eating experience!
Always a great place to eat! The atmosphere is amazing and everyone is so helpful. It's like walking into a book!! Magical and good food. 
The potatoes are delicious. However, sadly ButterBeer is not Vegan because they will not serve it to you without the topping. The majority of the drink is Vegan but the topping contains dairy.
The best hidden gem at Universal is in the Three Broomsticks in the family feast. We ordered this both times we visited for a family of four adults. With four of us we could not finish all the food. We had salad, corn on the cobb, ribs, chicken, vegetables, and potatoes. The food was prepared very well and they bring it to your table. We also really liked the pear cider, I know butter beer is the big thing but give the pear cider a try if you like fruit juices. The other reason to give this a shot is if everyone in your group likes what is prepared you will save money vice ordering individual dinners.
We actually ate there twice-breakfast and dinner. We preferred breakfast where they offered a full British breakfast, continental breakfast along with our selections of American breakfast (bacon, eggs, potatoes, sausage and croissant) or pancakes platter. Dinner was pub grub, British style. Our roasted chicken was average. Nothing extraordinary. Forget the food-the details in the design of the space keeps you looking around the restaurant and not at your plate. Must admit, for quickly served food, the staff was very cheerful and friendly. They bought into the illusion. If you have picky eaters, go in for a quick drink and soak up the atmosphere, then get a slice off pizza in another area of the park. If you are truly a witch or wizard, you will love eating here.
"the food was ""meh"" at best and certainly overpriced but the experience of eating at such a whimsical eatery was worth the price"
I was so looking forward to eating at The Three Broomsticks. Two years ago, my husband and I ate at the Leaky Cauldron, and I loved everything about it. The atmosphere in The Three Broomsticks is, of course, perfection for any Harry Potter fan. I also have no complaint with the service.My husband had a shepherd's pie, which he said was mediocre. I had the Cornish pasties, which pretty much were the consistency of cardboard with very little taste. I don't think I even finished them.I would try The Three Broomsticks again just for the atmosphere, but I would definitely order something different (or possibly just get a dessert or a ButterBeer).
The attention to detail in the decor is unbelievable...the food on the other hand...not so much. I would rate the food at the same level as cafeteria food.
"Essentially a cafeteria style establishment with themed surrounds and a good view of ""Hogwarts Castle"" in Hogsmeade at Universal's Islands of Adventure. The food is essentially the same as with the Leaky Cauldron in USO."
I had the smoked chicken and rosemary potatoes, which were pretty good. Pricing was between $14 and $20 depending on your order. To be honest, I was surprised by how hearty the foods they offered (turkey leg, half a chicken, rack of ribs, etc.). And, you could get butterbeer as your drink. So, kind of a win-win.
Great food, especially for theme park with out a reservation. Service was not FAST, but was expedient and efficient. Try the Butterbeer Ice Cream (but don't confuse that with the Potted Cream...those are not the same thing!)
We loved our meal here. This restaurant is located in Hogsmeade at Islands of Adventure. It gets busy, so eat at off times, 11am or earlier or 2pm or later. We ate at 11 and had no problem getting our food or a table. Ordering was efficient and the place was exactly like the movie. We heard from our guide that the restaurant was built first and the movie set was modeled after it! We found the food to be serviceable and the portions large and satisfying. Our teenage son and my husband both ordered the turkey leg and said later they could've split one. I had the shepherds pie and salad. The highlight of the meal was of course the butterbeer, our favorite was frozen and it was served in a commemorative mug for $12 (if you don't want the mug, you need to specify that). It tasted like butterscotch and had a frothy whipped cream head. The kids loved it! I liked mine too but couldn't finish it. I liked the pumpkin juice and pumpkin fizz better. They weren't quite as sweet, but our group was divided on those. Order one to share and if you like it, get your own. 
This restaurant is located in the Diagon Alley(tm) part of Universal Studios. We had obtained early admission to Universal studios and had just experienced the Escape From Gringotts after having to get up and dash from our on-site hotel without getting breakfast. (I think that having NOT just eaten was a good thing for experiencing this attraction, which had a very short wait time at that hour).We were able to place our order at the counter after getting explanations of the dishes from the friendly Wizard and receiving our included drinks from him and then were ushered to our table by a friendly Witch along with our table number / candlestick. All of the tables were reserved for the use of the restaurant's customers, unlike at some other locations. The decor is awesome and very true to the film version of Harry Potter. Our orders were delivered hot and fresh and quickly. The coffee was acceptable and one of our party got the hot Butterbeer(tm) which to me was the best of all versions of it -- cold, frozen, or hot. The vittles were of adequate size, flavor and texture with both bacon and sausage links. We were then able to face the rest of the dangers of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter refreshed and ready for action!!
It was so fun eating in Three Broomsticks! Just be prepared to wait! There was a line going out and around the building. Thankfully there are employees to help manage the lines. 
We had apple pie and ice cream. Note one apple pie can feed two people. It was really delicious. The staff are very friendly and helpful.
We didn't expect much but the food was very good - especially for theme park food. We had the chicken and rosemary potatoes.The orgnization inside the restaurant was impressive. Employees were busy cleaning tables and assisting patrons to locate a table. Great experience. Highly recommend. 
The ribs and chicken dish was delicious and easily shared between two. Wanted a hogs head mug but could only get it with beer in it and it was took expensive to buy just to then go tip the beer out.
We had the American breakfast option here . Food was expensive but really good. Pancakes tasted really good - not made from the standard store bought mix. The decor is done well and the staff is very helpful and friendly.TIPS:- They have a nice outside seating facing the castle where you can take some good photographs.
My teenage daughter loved the Harry Potter tie-in. The fish-n-chips I had was pretty decent, actually, considering it's theme park food. The lack of good organization around moving people from ordering to pickup to seating area is frustrating and really could use some work.
We ordered the Feast. It was 52.99. Full salad, ribs, chicken, 4 full ears of corn, potatoes and mixed vegetables. What a great deal. More than enough for our family of four. It tasted good too. It was a very crowded park day and you stand in line to order and wait for your food before they seat you. This was quick and the meal is worth the wait. We also recommend the frozen butter beer. We tried all the kinds...Even a float made from butter beer ice cream we bought across the street (an insider suggestion). The restaurant is cool, staff friendly. We enjoyed the whole experience.
Was pleasantly surprised here. Bigger menu than I thought - fish & chips, smoked turkey leg, rotisserie chicken, shepherd's pie, etc... It's pub food done right. Service was friendly and I liked how the worker's motioned you over to an empty table in the crowded dining area--no searching for spaces. I had a ginormous turkey leg. Tasty!
We ate here for lunch. There was a bit of a wait to order. Once you order you get in another line to pick up your food and then you wait again for them to direct you to a table. The food was okay. Not sure we would eat here again but now we can say we tried it. My family on the way out saw the Shepherds pie and wished they would have ordered that instead of what we had chicken, fish and spareribs.
This is a terrific lunch or dinner stop for an Harry Potter fan. Awesome atmosphere and yummy food! There are options for kids and adults--plus the butter beer is delicious.
I had the best fish and chips of my life here. I will dream about those fish and chips. Lol. Seriously though, the food was delicious and they're super speedy. It's cafeteria style dinning: You order and pay at the register, pick up your food from the counter, and find a place to sit where ever you can! And the ambiance, like all of the Harry Potter stuff at Universal, is out of this world.
The spareribs are amazing. Friendly staff. Outdoor seating available. FULL bar. Very busy for lunch.
The breakfast was okay, but the restaurant itself was awesome as were the servers and help!! Basically cafeteria food but it was hot and served by a wonderful wait staff!! Had a great experience, we heard their lunch and dinners are outstanding, especially the fish and chips! Don't know we weren't there for lunch or dinner. If you buy the prepaid meals do the lunch or dinner plans, definitely way more worth it!!!
Hungry kids at 9 am in Hogsmeade, one fussy and one Celiac - took a chance here (had avoided in the past because of the Celiac) and was pleasantly surprised. When told there was a celiac, had someone walk everyone through the prep - they made up a special plate - separately prepared - no croissant or sausage, added extra bacon - for the celiac. Fussy kid devoured the potatoes and eggs. No need to rush for a table as they manage seating well through servers (wont let you into seating area without a tray of food). Good coffee. Pricing was in line with expectations for a theme park.
Great food, Well organised, Smashing staff and very authentic. Ate there twice.Great both times. Well worth a visit.
We ate at both the HP restaurants.this one for lunch. The food was okay..nothing particularly special compared to the breakfast we had at the Leaky Cauldron. The ordering was easy enough and we decided to eat out back..which was not as crowded with a great view. There were also some hungry turtles and fish in the water nearby. The outdoor eating area felt a tiny bit secluded which was very welcome because of the crowds elsewhere.
Too much salad and not enough of your main course for the cost. I had gotten the shepherds pie, which was very good, but I could have done with a bigger pie rather than a huge plate of salad.
My husband, son and I had lunch and ordered the great feast for four people. It could feed four but the three of us did a good job on almost every bit of it. It is $55 but worth it. You start with salad to share, followed by ribs and chicken along with corn on the cob, veggies, and delicious roasted potatoes with onions. Skip the individual meals----this is the best value in theme park food we have found. They offer butter beer or two beer choices that were also good. 
Harry Potter fans will love the theme of this restaurant. Toughest decision is eating inside the beautifully themed restaurant or outside with view of Hogwarts castle. Food is decent, but pricey. Roasted potatoes very good, spar ribs and fish pretty good options. A place where the experience is the main draw, but food is above average.
The place was crowded, but the attendants man the tables well. Overall, I was satisfied with the wait. We had the feast. It was good. The chicken was tender, the ribs were bland and just OK, the salad was not very good, the potatoes were greasy, the corn was very good, and the other vegetables were nothing special. The Butted Beer was great. We got it hot and frozen. We checked it off the list but won't likely return. 
One of my family's favorite restaurants in the WWHP. Great food and although it was pricey, it was actually worth it. The waitstaff was upbeat and polite and in character. The inside of the restaurant made you feel like you were really in one of the HP books. 
I am going to put this into perspective very quick- if you did not like your food it's because you tried something besides the rotisserie chicken. The roasted potatoes and corn and everything that comes with the rotisserie chicken meal was delish! I do not eat corn so my husband had the corn and I had the potatoes. They were seasoned with rosemary and some other spices- very good. We visited this place on day 3 of our 4 day Disney vacation, that is important for this reason: the food at Disney sucks. In other words nothing really tasted fresh it all tasted like it had come out of a freezer. So with that being said when we arrived at Universal I remembered the meal we had in 2013 and immediately looked forward to some real food. This food does not taste like the food from Disney- it's authentic true to the movie stuff. I have not had gilly water or pumpkin juice but I have had the butter beer (frozen is best). TIP****** We purchased the dining pass that included the souvenir cup, a snack, and a meal. We were able to use our dining pass to eat at the Three Broomsticks and we used the snack on the dining pass for the butter beer. SAVED SOME $$ doing it that way
It doesn't get much better! It may be possible that the 5th star is just because I love Harry Potter. We were able to order quickly and didn't have to wait that long at all. We ordered the Great Feast to share and it was more than enough food. The platter had chicken, ribs, corn on the cob, potatoes, peppers, broccoli, carrots, and it also came with a nice big salad. The salad was very tasty and very thing tasted nice and fresh. The dressing was light and had a nice zest to it. The potatoes was AMAZING!! I could have eaten all of them if it hadn't been rude. The corn on the cob was cooked perfectly and tasted very fresh. All of the meat on the board was tender and tasted great. I also had the pumpkin juice and I have to tell you...it was one of my favorite thing ever. Since returning, we've ordered more of it to be mailed here to our home. If you are in Universal you need to go to the Three Broomsticks!
A true fans dream, the earlier you get there the better. Had the fish and chips and it reminded me of London. 
We decided to eat here for lunch with our 6 year old and 9 month old. The queues weren't too bad, but it was really frustrating that you can't order soft drinks here, only butter beer. The layout is great and if you look up it's pretty impressively done. Outside you can see ducks, turtles and fish in the water below.
First thing first the food was great. The prices were good. This is a restaurant in a theme park so it will be more expensive. For Harry Potter fans, eating here is amazing. It is just like the movie. While the food is good, it is also cafeteria food. The food is not fancy but it is good. The music from the movies play as you eat so you feel like you are in the movie. 
Enter here and you are truly transported into another world. There are exact replicas of props and I read some of the suitcases on the second floor, visible from the seating area, are actual props. Most of our experiences here have been positive, however I would say that if you do buy dinning passes and have several people in your group, make sure to write your name on them. Our cashier asked for all of them instead of just taking our orders one at a time; they all had different amounts (group of 8) and she seemed incredibly stressed and wasn't too pleasant about it. She did later apologize, but I think names on cards and allowing us to just order one at a time would of help to avoid that situation. Also, the servings are huge! I think I could feed a family of four with one plate. We usually have a late lunch here and just a quick piece of fruit for breakfast and a light dinner because of the serving sizes.
I love how they have all the food displayed so you can see what everything looks like instead of just a description. They have a thing called the great feast that is $55 but feeds 4 to 5 people easily. I had the rotisserie chicken and it was excellent. The skin was flabby but I don't eat the skin anyway. The chicken was very moist and the potatoes were good. 
Dark, with quirky timber-framed roofs that soar upwards, the walls covered with deer antlers, and enjoy good food - chicken, fish and chips and the like. This is a better place to eat that the fast-food outlets that exist elsewhere as you gain the experience of the world of Harry Potter and the food is far better. Definitely recommended. 
We are local and spent the day at Islands of Adventure; we decided to check out Three Broomsticks.Very similar to Leaky Cauldron in theme and menu, they really went over the top in details. Huge vaulted ceilings with beams, cauldrons, big windows and plenty of tables.My husband had the Half Chicken, it came with a full ear of corn and a nice sized portion of roasted potatoes.I had the Smoked Chicken Salad - I large pile of iceberg and romaine lettuce, a couple of tomato wedges, sliced cucumber, shredded carrots and corn kernels. It was topped with a really nice pile of warm, moist, smokey chicken meat. We were really happy with the quality, the size of the portion and the price. It was a great value for the price.
We enjoyed lunch at Three Broomsticks. The atmosphere was really cool. The food was a bit pricey but there was a real food selection. Also, it was much better than a burger in the park. The kids loved the butter beer and we enjoyed the meat pies.
Around Universal, you often see hot dog and chips combos with no drink included for $13. Here, for just a few dollars more, you get 1/2 roasted chicken, delicious potatoes, a full corn on the cob, and free ice water all while dining inside a Potter fan's dream. The food is good! We ate here twice on this most recent trip. The platter is a cost-efficient way to get a variety of meats and vegetables with a salad. We all wanted chicken, so 4 of us ordered the smoked chicken platters, ice waters, and ate for less than $40. The next day we weren't as hungry so we ordered two plates and split them. All you have to do is ask for extra plates. We found them very accommodating such as substituting extra potatoes instead of the corn for one of us. We ate on the patio that time with a different and pretty view of Hogwarts. You can use your Butterbeer souvenir mug here to get the $1.50 lemonade refills. TIPS - the outside line moves fast even if there are 25 people in line. It's worth it. If you want a Butterbeer, just walk right in the bar side of this restaurant and you can order there, bypassing the long lines outside at the carts. You may spend $1 more tipping the bartender, but it's well-themed (watch the Boar's head) and fast. We ate breakfast here on our last trip, but now I think we're hooked on the lunch and dinner options.
Good choice of English food. However the choice at the Leaky Cauldron, were better. The Pear cider was great.
Really neat to be able to eat at the restaurant featured in the series but the food itself isn't that great. And it is really expensive. The ordering and picking up, along with the seating, leave a lot to be desired. We tried the fish-n-chips, ribs and chicken platter, and the turkey leg. It was just okay except for the turkey leg - that was really awful. Got a butter beer at the end and that was the best part of the whole meal. Definitely shareable as it is really sweet.
We love Harry Potter and this was our second Thanksgiving dinner at the Three Broomsticks. Food is amazing and the atmosphere just like the movie. Like you are really in Hogsmeade at the restaurant! Love it. Go! 
 Whether or not you're a Harry Potter fan, this is a great place for a quick lunch in the parks. The Shepard's pie and fish and chips are really good. Its a counter service restaurant but the staff is extremely helpful. My daughter didn't like her entree and they replaced it with something else when they noted she wasn't eating (they wanted her experience to be great).  The atmosphere is something right out of the books/movies and a great experience
Our family of four enjoyed lunch at Three Broomsticks. We ate around noon and only had about a 20 minute wait. They hand out menu boards to look at while you are in line and then you order at a register and pick up your food at another counter. They will then seat you. They give you free water if you ask for it. The four of us each got a Butterbeer non-alcoholic) and wish we shared as they are sweet and bill was $71 for lunch. They were delicious though! The kids were both able to get kids meals even though the menu said ages 9 and under so that was nice. Fun atmosphere!
We ate here for lunch on our last visit. The roasted chicken and the fish and chips are very good. The cost is not that great and is about par with every other eating place in the park.
This was the best theme park meal we had including the Disney ones. After a long morning of rides and lots of walking we wanted somewhere to eat where we could sit in A/C.There was a line just outside to get into the restaurant. Once inside there is another line to the registers to place your order.My husband and I split the roast chicken and ribs plate. That was enough for us. It was very tasty. The family shared a frozen butterbeer - YUM and a pumpkin juice - kinda weird.It was nice to be able to sit and enjoy lunch.
The setting is amazing as if you were immersed in the book but the food itself is very poor and expensive. 
Average park food. It is a shame when so much effort was put into the rest of the Wizarding World! Stick to frozen butterbeer and save your appetite for another place.
As with all theme parks it was expensive especially with 4 growing boys but the food was good. They herded us through fairly quickly and the staff was very good.The atmosphere was great!
While in line you get to look at the menu and see examples in the window. The food is prepared quite fast and you get to sit in an authentic harry potter style restaurant that makes it feel like you're in the movie. Delicious lunch that kept us full all day. 
We're annual passholders, so we don't usually eat in the park - but we had a guest from out of town who was visiting all of the glory that is Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade for the first time. It can be fairly spendy to eat in a theme park, so I'm always on the lookout for a reasonably good deal.The Great Feast did NOT disappoint! At the time of my visit, it was (I think) $53.99 for four people, and then any additional people were $13.49 (again, off the top of my head). Here's what's included:*ribs (2-3 per person)*roasted chicken (drumstick + thigh, I think - definitely a good-sized portion)*corn on the cob (1 per person)*garden salad*assorted roasted/steamed vegetables: potatoes, broccoli, carrots, red bell peppersDrinks are NOT included, so we had complimentary water. ;)That may not sound like a lot of food, but - oh my gosh - we were so stuffed when we left! We couldn't even finish all of the vegetables, though we gave it our best effort. :)Of course, they do have other food that you can order, if someone in your party doesn't care for the Feast food - but we were impressed to get that much food (and even a nice amount of healthy stuff - the salad and the steamed/roasted veggies). Oh, and yeah, the ambience is nice too. (*grin*)
If you like Harry Potter. You have to eat here. They have done a great reproduction of what you have seen in the movie. In general, the prices of food in this theme park are very reasonable, they also have surprisingly good food.
We had a great meal at this restaurant & it was well worth the wait! The food was original and quite delicious!!
We ate a late breakfast here on our visit to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. It was quite tasty! The food came out quickly, and the workers in the restaurant were friendly. One offered the suggestion to leave through the back so that we could have a nice view of the Hogwarts Castle from their patio. Of course, if you are a Harry Potter fan, eating here is a must just because it is part of the experience. You won't be disappointed!
This restaurant is everything a Harry Potter fan dreamt of! The theming makes it! You feel like you are really there! The Food is quick, however it is very nice and being British was nice to hear and see British dishes after so long! One tip we were given was to get Universal Dining Plans and use them at the Harry Potter restaurants as that way you got value for money as the dishes were expensive, however we saved quite a bit going this way! And provided an easy, cashless way to get food!Without hesitation i would eat here again, especially if i was on the Dining Plan!
We rode a few coasters and decided to grab lunch - the line wasn't too long, and our hostess was great and introduced us to the couple beside us. The food was good for the money, and the environment was just cool for those of us who love Harry Potter. They serve all the variations of butterbeer - try them! This is a must for HP lovers!
"This is a charming place to eat and the food is fairly good for park food. Prices are what you expect in a resort. Lots of authentic British fare. However, we did not realize that you had to walk up, order, and collect your food at a counter, and fell for a package with ""reservations"" as part of the deal. The reservations mean nothing: you don't need to be on time and you wait in the same line as those without reservations. Furthermore, when buying it as part of the deal, you get 1 entree and 1 drink per person, with some restrictions. We would have been better off to buy a la carte, as my children could not finish the entrees (they could have shared) and frozen butterbeer (our favorite) was not an included beverage, though cold or hot butterbeer was. When I asked what the point of a reservation was, a staff member said so that they could plan for volume -- no benefit for the customer at all. Still, it's fun and I'd recommend it."
Entering the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, there will be rides, wands and an endless amount of Harry Potter merchandise. After all of this fun, you will need to get some grub, the Three Broomsticks is a sizeable restaurant with British standard food fare with a few magical highlights.For any reader of Harry Potter, Butterbeer has a certain fascination. I was particularly excited to try some Butterbeer. It turns out that Universal Studios has figured out that everyone is Butterbeer crazy because there are outdoor drink dispensaries and you can get it in many different forms. Let me list a few of the varieties which you can find most of them at the Three Broomsticks. There is cold butterbeer, warm butterbeer, frozen butterbeer, and a butterbeer potted cream (ice cream). All of these varieties of butterbeer are non-alcoholic but there is an alcoholic version of butterbeer as well. After a lot of choice, we ordered the frozen butterbeer which had frozen shake consistency which was very tasty. Butterbeer is crème soda with a buttescotch flavored whipped cream on top. For Three Broomsticks restaurant, there is almost always a line. It is good to go on an off-peak time to enjoy your meal the most. When you enter, there are wax or plastic examples of the food in the line. This is very helpful to get a portion size. You order in the counter and you receive a number which is put on your tray. They are very organized and have staff seating you at selected tables. This place must be a mad house during the summer months.For the food, it was average British-style food. We ordered fish and chips and the chicken ribs platter. The chicken ribs platter was very filling and flavorful. The fish and chips were a-okay.The dining area was themed so beautifully with all of the detail that you would expect. There is an extremely high ceiling which really is awesome. There were a few corner seating areas which would be great for larger groups.After our meal, we exited the side where there was a bar for drinks. There were quite a few drink options alcoholic and non-alcoholic.I would say that it would be a fun visit for the young and the young at heart.
Both this and Leaky Caldron are part of the Harry Potter areas, and with similar food, but even though the theming is great the food was not great. The fish n chips was more fatty and greasy than when we ate at the Leaky Caldron leaving us feeling a little sick afterwards. Shame.
Its definitely worth a visit if your a Harry Potter fan since the decor is great and there is plenty of room to sit in. The food on the other hand was very average and pricey for what was given. Always make sure to grab some butterbeer!
We stopped here to get lunch while at Islands of Adventure and it was very nice as we ate outside with a great view of Hogwarts castle. The staff was nice and the food was decent. Enjoyed the view.
The twist being pub food and butterbeer (frozen, cold, or hot). Other than that, we've all seen the variations of roasted chicken, BBQ ribs, corn on the cob, fish and chips. The Feast option ($54 to feed four) was appealing to me, starving as I was from walking around but hubby nixed it. Wise man. The secrets to Three Broomsticks are these: know what you want to order before you queue, or you'll make decisions on the fly. There is a display of the food mid-way through the line. Also, unless you have to be subjected to AC and themed surroundings, take your trays out back. The rest of Hogsmeade can be stuffed with people, yet not many know about the quiet seating area behind Three Broomsticks. If you are lucky, you'll get the choice solo table overlooking the lake.I'll find my fix for fish and chips elsewhere, as I found both Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley reeked of fish this trip. Next time around, I'll grab food from the kebab stand and carry it to behind Three Broomsticks.
Pricey, but worth the stop!! The workers will not break character!! We had a good visit! Overall, it's pricey but worth a stop (at least to walk around!)
We had the pea soup and it was delicious!! Lots of fun and it was good to have something to eat that was filling and not just junk food.
The Three Broomsticks was a great place to have breakfast, made you feel like you were right in Hogsmeade, staff friendly and accommodating. However, the food was average, pancakes overdone, and the only thing that was hot were the potatoes (delicious potatoes).
We shared the Pancake Breakfast and the English Breakfast. It was great to be able to try new things. We were offered HOT Butterbeer, which we understand to only be offered in the Fall. We love it! It should be offered year round!
Required dining for any Harry Potter nerd. Not a lot in the way of vegetarian options, but it's the Three Broomsticks so you make it work. I ordered the leek soup and salad combo with a side of potato wedges. It was actually quite tasty, and prefect food for the rainy day. Inside the restaurant is super cool, and it has great views of Hogwarts in the outdoor seating in the back. Great for photo ops! . Also had to try the butter beer, which sounding nasty to me but again.. Harry Potter, so you do it. I actually like it a lot, tasted more like a cream soda.
Stopped for lunch on our trip to Islands of Adventure....neat place if you like Harry Potter. The menu is small but the roasted potatoes are fantastic! 
I don't know if I would eat here for lunch or dinner because the food is very heavy and British which isn't necessarily my favorite things to eat at a humid theme park but breakfast seemed to be the way to go! I imagine this place and the Leaking Cauldron get packed for lunch and dinner but breakfast right as the park is opening was very open in terms of choice of seating and the lines for ordering. I also liked that they had British and American breakfast options. I ordered pumpkin juice because I had to give it a try being a Harry Potter fan (it was just ok, too different for my taste). However my husband didn't want any kind of juice; he just wanted a bottle of water. Well the elderly woman taking our order acted like we had just commited the most egregious offense because each breakfast COMES with a juice so you can't just have water! All she had to do was casually explain this to us instead of dramatically rolling her eyes and throwing her hands in the air. I mean how unreasonable is it for someone to wanted bottle water at a theme park to stay hydrated instead of a sugary drink? So we got him some orange juice and paid extra for a bottle of water so that she would calm down. That was our only poor experience here; luckily the food was filling and tasty and we really enjoyed the atmosphere. 
Our children are BIG Harry Potter fans and we thought it would be great to experience this restaurant. The staff greeting and taking the order were friendly and helpful. The food however was awful. The portion sizes are miniscule. The pies (e.g. shepherds pie) are served in tiny foil containers and are portioned for a small child. The fish in the fish and chips dish was overly salted and almost inedible. The chips served with the fish and chips were few and not traditional style British chips, they were more like wedges. Surely, if you are trying to give a British style food experience you can make proper British chips. We were extremely surprised to find that the food was served on plastic plates with plastic cutlery. Given the cost of the meal there should be proper plates and knives and forks. Overall not a good experience.
Great cooked breakfast in impressive surroundings! Staff friendly and the service was well organised! 
We had lunch here mainly for the experience. The atmosphere is really cool and like everything else in the Wizarding World, perfect on Harry Potter details. The service at the counter was not helpful at all in ordering. It wasn't busy so I guess they just don't enjoy their jobs. It was the only place I felt this way. The woman who sat us (and our candlestick) sat the boys in front of the Sirius Black wanted poster and pointed it out to the boys. That was neat. The food was ok, but I say that because I am not a huge fan of English food. That being said, it was a good experience to have.
We are here twice while at Universal, once for lunch and once for breakfast. We got the family feast for lunch which was very good. It served a family of 4 (two adults, two teenagers), and we had food leftover. The salad, corn, and potatoes were good, but the vegetables, chicken and ribs were excellent! The staff is efficient. They serve Butterbeer frozen here which is something you have to experience. We had vouchers for breakfast which was part of the package at our resort. (Picture). You can choose from any breakfast and any beverage. I had the American breakfast with cold Butterbeer. Overall, the food is pretty above average for park food, the staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is good. 
Good food, good service - especially as crowded as it was. Everywhere you look is more and more wizarding world-related detail. Just a fun place to visit and have lunch!
We had a voucher to eat at this restaurant as part of our Harry Potter Vacation Package with Universal. We found the meal to be hot,and plentiful. Drinks of hot Butterbeer were included...Yumm!
Of course if you love Harry Potter you are going to eat at the Three Broomsticks, the inside was a great replica and the back patio had a beautiful view of the school, the food was alright, I went with the fish and chips and the fish seemed to have more batter than fish.
We went here for lunch because we wanted the ambiance, and experience. The line was rediculously long, but it moved quickly. They have their system down. You order at a counter, get your drinks, and a number, then stand in another line, and wait for a table to open. Again the wait was fairly quick. As soon as one party leaves, they are there to swabb down the table and within less than 2 minutes a new party is sittting at the table. Food comes out fairly quickly. Food is pub faire, and of decent quality, but somewhat pricey for what you get. Butterbeers are a must try while in Potterland, but beware they are $6 a piece! If you are just dying to say you ate here then do it, you will feel like a cow being herded to the trough, but can you blame Universal for capitalizing on our willingness to shell out rediculous amounts of money for a day of Harry Potter Fantasy. If you want far better service, and infinately better food, then eat at Finnagan's, which is also in Universal Studios Park, just not in Diagon Alley. 
This is a great place to rest and get out of the heat while maintaining the illusion of staying in character. The food was mostly British and surprisingly good for an amusement park.
We didn't eat here but we looked around inside. It is a lovely building and well worth taking a look.
The food was good not anytning fantastic though. The building was great to be in and the kids really loved the smaller chairs.
I really loved the fish and chips! The inside was amazing and the fact that it was connected to the Hogs Head made it easier to grab a few beers without losing our table. Spacious, detailed, the cast always in character, relevant food for the theme. My favorite restaurant in IOA.
Reasonable cost and very large portions. I had the American breakfast and didn't need to eat again until the evening. The atmosphere takes you right into a Harry Potter novel
It was nice to see other food that fries everywhere you go. The food is English style, with chunky wedges and lots of other choices. The kids menu is good to. Enjoyed the meal for lunch. It does appear to be the only place to sit and eat a meal at Hogsmeade.
if it is a slow day and you need some calories, little kids would love it, but the food is really bad- better places in the park for sure- but I guess its an experience
I loved walking into this establishment because it felt like I was in the movie. Themed down to the detail on the inside. I ordered the fish and chips which was amazing. The sweet tea was amazing as well. I just sat for about 30 minutes after my meal and enjoyed the atmosphere. So dark, inviting, and cool!
Good quick serve food. Staff are friendly and helpful. A magical atmosphere. Ribs here were good and generous for the price. Also, try the Butter Beer Ice Cream.
Really enjoyed lunch here - order your choice at the till, collect food then wait to be seated by the floor staff. Portions on the small/med side (big enough for me), I had fish n chips which came in the form of 3 small pieces of battered fish which were freshly cooked and wedge chips, 2 choices of beer - one a red ale 'Hogs Head Brew' and one a lager 'Dragons Scale'. I can recommend the Hogs Head ale. Really pleased there are reduced 'fizzy pop' options on the menu. Lovely HP themed restaurant although very busy and popular - you will be queuing out the door.
Another great place to eat and see. The decor ties in well with the area. Prices were a bit higher but worth it. They have booths and tables in middle and could be put together for larger groups. You order and pay at the front and sit down with your number and runner drops it off at your table. They clean up the table too. We came at 10am to do a brunch like meal. So we didn't lose out after getting in the park early time frame.
We ate here and enjoyed the feast meal between five of us and still had enough food to go around. I think Harry Potter pals will enjoy the butter beer and the atmosphere. The food is pretty good, too. I enjoyed the eatery and company the most. We had 7 in the party.
This is definitely worth a meal just for the novelty! It was fun to eat in a Harry Potter themed pub-like setting. The food is expensive but the Butterbeer is worth a taste. The staff were all in costume and highly organised.
The food was tasty, but nothing extraordinary. This was the least amazing thing in all of Harry Potter world. Some of the menu items were very filling and a good option for sharing, but other dishes were very small.
If you are eating at the Three Broomsticks be sure to try out the French Fries, they are rustic, chunky and simply delicious, best chips in Florida ! Also if you are trying Butter Beer, please be aware that it comes normal, frozen or hot ! Staff recommend it hot but on a sunny day you might prefer frozen, The normal is verrry sweet (butterscotch) so maybe one to share is enough ! If you are not sure whether to order Pumpkin Juice ask for a free sample !
It was a decent experience. Fish and chips were wonderful, the Cornish pasty was not great. Too small and mushy. 
Sitting in this place was so magical and seeing the architecture was absolutely breath taking. Food was pretty good too! the fish and chips were delightful!
I'm not an over the top Harry Potter fan, but I like the movies a lot and watched all seven with my family just before visiting the Wizarding World Of Harry Potter. The whole Wizarding World Of Harry Potter at Universal is probably the best and most meticulously detailed theming I've ever seen in a park. And the Three Broomsticks is no exception. One thing we noticed in at least two the Universal Studios dining areas is that you cannot sit in the dining area unless you have a meal tray in hand. I think this is a really good thing.We got in line in the queue that started outside the door and snakes a short distance inside. If you have to wait in the queue, there is a window inside you'll pass by that has a display of all the dishes you can choose from menu so you'll know what comes with each meal. The wait queue ends at a host/hostess station where you will be directed to one of 5 or 6 stations to order and pay for your food. Even though the line started outside it moved pretty quickly. From the order/pay counter you are then directed to a specific line (they're numbered) where the staff will assemble your tray and pour your drinks (they do serve alcohol here). Then it's off to the last very short queue where another host/hostess will find an open table that will accommodate your party and seat you (I called it a queue but you're seated petty much immediately). It's all very well organized and in a super crowded park, the organized way they move you through this dining experience is very much appreciated.The restaurant itself is themed as meticulously as the rest of the park. The place is clean and the staff is polite, accommodating and efficient.The food is excellent. There's something for everybody, while it's counter service, it's not fast food or typical quick service type food. These are very substantial and satisfying meals. I got the Rotisserie Smoked Chicken Platter with a Dragon Scale beer. You might find the same type of food at a King Richard's type renaissance fair (turkey legs, shepherd's pie, rotisserie chicken, etc). There's also a very good selection of sides, desserts, and beverages. I also thought the prices were pretty reasonable. Based on our experience I would definitely, and highly, recommend the Three Broomsticks (after thinking about it while writing this review I changed my initial rating from a four to a five).Hope this review helps!
We ate here with our family for both breakfast and dinner. Breakfast is rather pricey ($16) but it came with our hotel package. Dinner, on the other hand, was very reasonable. We ate the 4 person banquet dinner and it was more than ample food for all 5 of us. The food is good and the atmosphere is really fun-especially for the kids!
Love the atmosphere, the COOL temperatures (especially on those sweltering days) and the butter beer is tasty. Food is average... nothing to write home about. But does offer an alternative to the usual theme park fare.
Food was reasonable priced. Kind of different ordering it. Had to wait in line until someone told you you could get in another line to order.
the Three Broomsticks accurately reflects the attention to detail that Universal put into the Wizarding World. As soon as you enter you feel like you are in that world, which is exactly what we had hoped it would be like. There's really only the potato and leek soup or a garden salad as a vegetarian option to eat for dinner, but for breakfast you can get the continental breakfast or porridge which are both delicious and vegetarian. Make sure to keep an eye out for the house elf up on the second story who appears from time to time
We stopped in around 6:30 pm. Three Broomstick is a counter service restaurant. There was a small line waiting to be assigned a register to place an order at and there appeared to be several tables available to sit at. We ordered the rotisserie chicken platters. The platters included a half chicken with an ear of corn and sliced potatoes. With drinks, non alcoholic, the cost was in the mid $30's. The biggest complaint I have is that once your order is placed the area you go to to pick up your order is congested and can be a challenge to carry your tray of food through to the seating area. As far as the food the chicken was very good. The chicken was cooked perfectly; it was hot and juicy. The corn and potatoes were good. I recommend going here and the next time I'm there in going to try the ribs because they liked really good also. 
We went in for breakfast - expect to pay - and the food was ok. We went in and not crowded. The person at register not friendly, not rude. We ended up splitting breakfast and added orange juice...was around $20. I would not go back but we try and get to each place once, many times more than once, this will be once.
My wife is a Harry Potter nut! She even has a Harry Potter tattoo (she's the real deal!).We liked the Three Broomsticks restaurant. Large portions, and a nice break from the heat for a bit.And the food wasn't as over-priced as it is at Disney.I recommend checking this place out during your visit.
A great place to enjoy the Harry Potter world experience with plenty of food choices. Always very busy but worth the wait.
Arrived with my family. We got cornish pasties for three people, one turkey leg and a child's fish and chips. With the park getting rides and attractions being spot on I thought the food would be.The cornish pasties were rubbish and tasted nothing like. I also thought I had received a child's portion they was that small.I think the chef needs a lesson on how a cornish should taste.My husband opted for the turkey leg which was really salty!The only decent meal was my daughter's which was the fish and chips. We all wished we had the kids meal!
Great Harry Potter themed restaurant. A must for HP fans, but food is theme park prices and inconsistent. The fish and chips ($13.99) were really good - tender, well cooked white fish with a nice breading and thick cut, crisp fries. But the pasties ($9.99) were awful.They are tiny, slightly larger than a frozen bite size pizza roll and didn't taste much better. Served with a wilted bit of iceberg lettuce and hard tasteless tomato wedges. Really disappointing. Butterbeer and pumpkin juice were good and so much fun to try. Nice patio with view of Hogsmeade and Hogswarts.
Fast service, delicious food, good value, and beautiful restaurant. Just like I pictured in the Harry Potter books! 
This restaurant was really cool! It was like eating in an old time English restaurant. Universal Studios really focused on the details when designing this restaurant. It had mismatched chairs, old looking pictures and the architecture of an old tavern. The food was delicious, which is rare for theme park food. My son had the Shepard pie and he ate the whole thing. My husband and I each had the fish and chips which was equally tasty. Oh and don't leave without tasting the butter beer, delicious. Also the pumpkin pie juice was very tasty.
Just go in expecting to pay for the experience. Trust me, it's worth it! The detail inside the restaurant is insane and you really feel as though you are in the Three Broomsticks in Hogsmeade. The food is average and overpriced as you would expect in a theme park. Sneak next door to the Hog's Head for drinks only. The frozen butterbeer is amazing!
The theming is great, can't fault them on that, and cannot comment on the food as we were stopping in for drinks at the Hogs Head pub. The frozen butterbeer was great.Unfortunately the staff were extremely rude and not helpful at all. They have a policy (unwritten, but everyone is magically supposed to know it) that only guests with food are allowed to sit at the tables inside (regardless of how busy/empty they are). It's fine to have such a policy, but please display clear signage if this is the case, so people can make an informed decision about spending their money, instead of just taking people's money and then barking at them to go outside afterwards. The staff's instructions were very unhelpful too. We wanted clarification (after verifying that no, we were definitely not allowed to sit at any tables inside), so asked where we were supposed to have our drinks if we weren't allowed to sit inside.The response was 'Outside'. 'Outside where, are there any seats?'. 'We have a patio'. 'Well where is this patio?'Then the guy rolled his eyes at me getting obviously frustrated at my lack of psychic ability. Guess they don't like muggles.
I enjoyed the dining experience, the food was OK, but the ambiance of the structure is fun, as are all the restaurants in Harry Potter World. There are so many people waiting in line, roaming around the restaurant, and the tables are sort of close together, that it detracts from the experience.
Great experience! There was a line; however, the staff helps the line move VERY quickly. The food was really good...try the FROZEN Butterbeer...we tried butterbeer in all forms, and frozen is the best!We also ordered the fish'n'chips with plenty of potato wedges and the roasted chicken, which had plenty of vegetables, all of which was incredible. We will definitely visit again...it's nice to have a place to sit down and relax in the cool air conditioning while enjoying the scenic British pub.
The Three Broomsticks was by far my favorite place to dine while visiting The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. The food tasted great! They served a lot of English foods like yorkshire pudding, toad in the whole, and just a general English breakfast. They also had american food there if you didn't want to stomach the english food. There options in drinks consist of butterbeer, pumpkin juice, and regular fountain drinks. The Three Broomsticks looked just like it did in the movie. It is definitely a place you need to visit while on your trip to Universal Orlando.
The menu is English but the food almost non recognisable. It's great for fans of the books and movies but I would not eat here again.
The food was good; we were especially impressed with the freshness of the fruit that was part of our meals. A great way to start the day!
We had a sumptuous feast at this great Harry Potter themed restaurant. Built to look like at it is in the films,. Excellent.
We ate here while visiting HP at Islands of Adventure and I have to say the food was decent. It is supposed to be English fare, but probably a watered down version. The place was decorated in the marvelous HP fashion. The staff was attentive and polite and helped you find seating. There are long benches to sit so this may be troublesome for those with leg issues. I believe the staff will try to accomodate you. I say that if you have come all this way, then why not eat here at least once. Be sure to notice all the details put into HP. The concept artists I feel really captured the book. It feels magical being here. If you order butterbeer, only get the frozen. The other is not as good.
This is a nice place to unwind after going on some of the rides and refueling for your day; the breakfast is a little on the expensive side but then again it is located in a theme park, that said the food is very tasty and they give fairly good sized portion's.
We felt the food was over priced and cold. The children didn't eat any of theirs, such a waste of money. Should have looked around the rest of the park for food. 
Immerse yourself into the world of Harry Potter and enjoy food from a menu fit for a Griffendor! This was a great place to have lunch - authentic in design, frequented by muggles and really interesting food choices. Part of a wonderful Harry Potter experience.
Roasted chicken, fish and chips, potato wedges, corn on the cob, beans, the famous Butterbeer (frozen or on the rocks). Fun atmosphere. Really similar to the movies. You order your food at a kiosk then the servers deliver to your table. It made things go smoothly and quickly at lunch time. Good food. Walk around and check out the small details and items on the shelves from the books/movies.
If you're a Harry Potter fan, this is a must. The wait can be long, especially during lunch time. The atmosphere is really cool and they put a lot of attention to detail into the restaurant. The food is expensive, as is everything in the park, but it's so worth it. It tastes great and is filling. 
"We were recommended to eat here for a hot breakfast by a cast member on a drinks cart so headed over as my daughter wanted to come here too. Our food was all freezing cold,obviously you pay theme park food prices and thats expected,but you at least expect to be able to eat the food.The ""manager""was very smiley and condesending,and the worst person i have ever come across in a universal park.My daughter was so excited to eat here as she is a massive Harry Potter fan,and we were all very disappointed with the lack luster experience and disgusting food.Who would want to eat cold scrambled egg etc?The meal for 4 of us cost $86,which for breakfast i felt was reasonable but like i said,only if its edible.Wont return here again."
Like everything in Universal expect most days here to be very busy. The lines may be long except in the late afternoon. The staff is very good, helpful and hardworking. The food is organized in such a way that there is no long time to wait once you've ordered and been seated. The family and I enjoyed having frozen butter beer and choosing from the British inspired menu. We ordered one of everything on the menu. Once in the park food purchasing for a family of five is on the expensive side but you need to eat to keep moving and the experience is fun most days. Food is tasty but portions are small/ average for the price. If you purchase a large reusable cup you get re-fills for the day. I personally don't drink soda/ soft drinks so my re-fills were water or sparkling water. For a change I allowed my kids soda as they were on vacation. Overall the family enjoyed the Three Broomsticks as it is part of the Harry Potter experience. 
I expected a better atmosphere in the Three Broomsticks given how amazing the rest of Hogsmeade is. This place is basically a cafeteria.At the Fortress at Louisbourg, for instance, the dishes and cutlery are all pewter and the napkins are cloth and there are no electric lights. Even the servers are authentically dressed.At the Three Broomsticks the cutlery and plates are plastic.I liked the Rotisserie chicken, my daughter, who usually loves fish and chips, didn't like the fish (it lacked seasoning). The garden salad was very disappointing and the dressing didn't help it enough. I liked the roast potatoes but my other daughter didn't. My son liked his chicken fingers.
We ate lunch at the Three Broomsticks one of the days we visited the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. The food was good and gave us our fill. The pricing was as expected being in a theme park. It was all part of the Harry Potter experience. The restaurant is well organized to service big crowds. The service was good, we got our food standing in line in a reasonable about of time, walked to the line to be seat and were shown to a table right away. We suggest eating here.
You are in a theme park, so you have to expect the high prices. It was about $80 to feed our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 teens). But it was actual food, not snack cart stuff. Eggs, sausage, bacon, pancakes etc. And that was a great way to fill up after the early park admission hours were over. But I would generally recommend skipping a sit down breakfast as it uses up quality short line time in the morning...Of course the butter beer is always good there.....Um black pudding was weird since we didn't know what it was. Googled it after eating and my teen girl was having trouble eating once she knew what she tried (essentially blood sausage combined with oats and put in sausage form). The line was surprisingly long for a morning, but I guess that's to be expected on a holiday weekend....Overall find a grab n go breakfast at your hotel if you can, if you can't try to push hunger til 11 when the lunch menu is a bit more varied and the price feels more to the meal.
We decided to stop and eat lunch here and it was actually very good food! The butterbeer was really good and a must try during your visit. The decor is consistent with the Harry Potter world and interesting to see.
The rave review for this place amuse me. This is a amusement park captive dining experience. That means it is expensive and not very distinctive. It's not bad food, though even authentic British fare is not my cup of tea. It's just nothing special, except that you are in Harry Potter world.
The Three Broomsticks is a good restaurant to grab a bite to eat when wanting quick service. The menu has a good few options from fish and chips, roast chicken, salads to sharing platters. They also have a kids menu. Butterbear and normal beers are served too. The food is good and the feeling of being in a Harry Potter pub is great. However, I will say that the food is quite expensive but is what you normally expect from theme parks.
I read that J.K. Rowling was very particular about the food served at the Harry Potter restaurants, and it shows. The ingredients are higher quality than typical theme park food, and there's an effort to make the meals healthy, such as including a salad with several items. There are a few things you can get at both The Three Broomsticks and The Leaky Cauldron at Diagon Alley in the other park. Both serve British fare. Some of the items unique to The Three Broomsticks include Cornish pasties with salad (little pastries filled with ground beef, I found them a bit small, dry and salty for my taste), Shepherd's Pie with salad (hearty ground beef and lamb in gravy with a few peas, to bed with mashed potatoes, Leaky Cauldron has Cottage Pie which is similar but doesn't include lamb--I really liked both), pear cider (like apple cider, but made of pears, I liked it), pumpkin juice (available carbonated and flat, the carbonated is like a pumpkin pie soda--somehow reminded me of a pumpkin ginger ale), Chocolate Trifle (a mix of chocolate cake, whipped cream and fresh strawberries)p--very good). You'll find traditional fish and chips and the famous Butterbeer (a butterscotch soda with creamy foam on top) at both restaurants. Also available, smoked chicken, turkey legs and spare ribs.The restaurant gets crowded at peak lunch time--typically 12-3. If you want to avoid crowds, you might try going at around 11 a.m. or for dinner. When crowded, there's an outdoor line, and a second line inside. You'll be directed to a register to order, and from there to a specific pick-up counter. After picking up condiments and utensils, you'll be led to a table (unless it's not crowded). This helps the flow--families can't stake out a table to sit and wait while someone waits in line to order. You have to get through the line first.An entree and drink for an adult will cost around $15-$20. There aren't a lot of little details as there are in the shops, but the overall atmosphere is good and makes you feel like you could be in the restaurant in Hogsmeade of the books.Universal has an official app with basic restaurant info (location, hours, etc), but there's a much better free unofficial app called Magic Guide for Universal Studios that includes menus with prices for all the restaurants at both parks and City Walk. It's worth downloading.
This dinning experience was wonderful. The staff seats guests so there is no time wasted wandering around looking for a place to eat your food. There is something for everyone to eat here and do not pass on dessert. Excellent quality. TIP: Dine at between 11 am to 11 45 AM for lunch to avoid long waits.
Yummy way to start your day! the English breakfast was filling and tasty. Eggs were great with a side of black pudding, bacon, and croissant. Tasted fresh and was hot. Kept us going in the parks.
We had 3 Broomsticks twice on our last trip to Universal Studios. We waited 10 or less minutes each day to be seated. Our party all had the fish and chips. We all enjoyed it. They are served with potato wedges and tartar sauce. Nice serving of 3 pieces of fish. The atmosphere is jumping, it's so beautiful inside, you feel like you're in the movie. My only complaint would be the tea that is served. Definitely not the kind of tea I was hoping for. But 5 stars all the way!
I absolutely LOVE this restaurant. The theming is perfect. When you eat there, you truly feel like you're in the middle of Hogsmeade and part of the Harry Potter story. And the food is fantastic. Everyone talks about the Butterbeer. But the pear cider and Hogshead brew are really good too. Give them a shot!
The food here is so good! Seriously, this is the only place I wanted to eat in the whole park (besides the Leakey Cauldron) because the food is so good here.The breakfasts have multiple choices of vegetarian, British and American foods.The lunches/dinners have no vegetarian options, but delicious British and American.It is a bit pricey, but the atmosphere alone is worth it. But the food being so good is a bonus ;)
Line ups are long but the staff does an excellent job of managing the queue. The line starts outside with a person directing you to which line to queue at. As you wait in line, there's a display showing replicas for the different items in the menu. Then there's another person that will direct you to which cashier to go to order your food. We started lining up at around 1:30pm and estimated that we waited 30 minutes. Don't worry about getting a table. Once you collect your food and drinks, another staff will ask how many is in your party and direct you to a table. Very civilized! I ordered the roasted chicken and potatoes. Very moist and tender, lacking a bit in flavor though. Potatoes were cooked just right. My sons and hubby ordered the fish and chips. You get 3 good sized cod pieces and potato wedges with tartar sauce but they are big eaters so I ordered a extra order of fish and chips without the chips for $11.00. Pricey but quality and flavor was good, the batter wasn't the thick and crunchy type just lightly battered so it gets soggy pretty fast so eat up! We also ordered 2 sides of the garden salad for variety. Just mediocre so if you have to have veggies, go ahead and order but otherwise I would skip it. I saw a lot of people ordered the Feast. That seems to be the best deal if you don't have picky eaters like mine. Now this is where it kind of went downhill. As we were chomping down our food,(we were starving) my son suddenly felt something wet and icky drop on his shoulder. We unfortunately sat underneath a moose's head sculpture that was hanging on the wall where the bird was perching. My son was very displeased and we called the manager. He explained that they have installed high pitched sensors within the restaurant to deter the birds from coming into the restaurant but there was 1 bird that keeps entering the restaurant. He did not offer to comp the meal. It would have been nice if he did. Otherwise, the food was very good and still worth the wait for the ambience. The frozen Butter beer is priced at $6.67 here but if you buy it from the carts outside, it's $7.00. Guess since the outside carts are so busy, they round up the price to make it easier.
I know it's a theme park themed restaurant but the food on reading appears appetising but the reality is disappointing. Do not choose the Cornish Pasty as it isn't a pasty you would recognise from home (UK), three samosa sized minced beef parcels that would shame a supermarket budget label offer. Choose the chicken or ribs, I had food envy! Oh and watch the sparrows that fly above within the restaurant - their offerings are not welcome in the tables below.
The whole family enjoyed our food in here and found it easy to please everyone.Service was good and the place looked exactly like you would expect a restaurant to look in Harry Potter Land!
Honesty it was the only restaurant at the park that I didn't like, the place is nice but the food terrible. Value-Price not good, you need to check the menu and serve FRESH SALADS.
"Having eaten on a previous day in the Leaky Cauldron, we thought it only right to try this one while at Islands of Adventure.Another queue, which is understandable, but initially outside, and then when you enter, you find more queuing before you are served, not impressed...Good portions of food, but not as good as the Cauldron and it lacks the ""spark"" that the Leaky Cauldron has."
I love everything Harry Potter. The place is perfect. Food is great. Expect to pay mid-range in the park, anywhere. 
"We ordered the ""feast"" at lunch time- included chicken, ribs, corn on the cob, potatoes, broccoli, it was $55 and we were able to feed 6 people by ordering the feast platter. The temperature of the food was not very warm and the corn was old and kind of smushed in like it had been sitting for awhile. Food did not taste that good either- I don't think anyone in our group enjoyed the food but the actual restaurant is really cool to look at."
OMG if you are traveling in a group of 4 or more, do yourself a favor at lunch/dinner and get the Great Feast. For $55 you get a huge garden salad, then 4 pieces of ribs, 4 chicken quarters, 4 ears of corn and generous helpings of mixed veg (carrots, broccoli & peppers) and potato. My family of 4 couldn't even eat it all. Best deal on good hearty food in a theme park EVER.
Recently spent four days exploring The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios in Orlando FL -- amazing experience! We ate four times at The Three Broomsticks in The Islands of Adventure theme park, three breakfasts and one lunch, and had great service and food (one breakfast was not as warm as the other two, admittedly). The method of handling all their guests worked as we did not really have a wait at any time. The meals were hearty and filling and overall, very good. Would definitely recommend eating here while visiting.
My family of 6 ate here for breakfast. The theme is great and we were all impressed by the food. I loved the oatmeal. There was fresh fruit, scrambled eggs and lots of other choices. We really felt like we were eating at three broomsticks! The price was actually pretty good too....highly recommend you try this place for great food and theme!
Went for a breakfast that was included in our universal package. I am a huge Harry Potter fan so they could have fed me cardboard and I would have loved it. My husband and daughter weren't to fussy for it. For me it was great just to eat there! 
"Looking remarkably like an over-scale Tudor British Pub Three Broomsticks benefits from its great location in Universal's Harry Potter universe. While probably better deals could be found in nearby Jurassic World the food here is as close to 'real food' one can get at Universal without the painful expense of an on-site sit down restaurant.The fish and chips seemed pretty close to the real UK version though the portions were a little small. Universal had the poor quality Heinz Malt Vinegar; they really should get the UK Sarsons version for an authentic taste. My teenager ordered the Mac and Cheese with Potato Wedges off the children's menu and got a good amount of food. My wife ordered the Roasted Chicken, Corn-on-the-Cob, and Roasted Potatoes and thought it was a bit much but good.Having enjoyed them on a recent trip overseas I mistakenly ordered the Cornish Pasties and Salad. While cheaper than the others it was a pitiful disappointment. The salad was mostly iceburg lettuce and one small tomato wedge. The Pasties were obviously three small 3"" beef filled empanadas that had obviously been frozen and cooked in the oven. I give this whole dish a pass.I heard the frozen Butter Beer was good if you have a sweet tooth. Free tap water and re-fills available if you ask nicely. While the rest of Islands of Adventure gives you a 10% AAA discount on meals (which adds up at these prices) The Wizarding World of Harry Potter does not...why? I guess because they can! They got Harry and Disney doesn't."
This and the leaky cauldron offer the best food in the entire Park! Highly recommended for lunch. Best to eat before the midday rush.
Our family ate here and found the food good. We have chicken and also fish and chips. The prices were reasonable--considering the location--and the service was efficient considering the crowds. 
Good selection, good portions and reasonabily prices.The restaurant has the feel from the movie, kids of all ages will enjoy.
You will spend a little more but it is really good and the service is fantastic. Great atmosphere, it really is the Harry potter World.
We were very impressed with the food selections and service. Very efficient process to order, pickup and find seating. We'll eat here again.
We did the early breakfast (got in before the park opened and was escorted stragight back to the restaurant). The place is amazing! The amount of detail in this place is insane and I spent most of the meal ignoring my food and taking in all the detail. I will say you're not going here for the food, it's about the experience and seeing how amazing this place is. The food was good, but it was not great by any means, very average. Remember, it's not about the meal it really is about the experience of being there.
Incredible Harry Potter Restaurant, you can feel that you are in one of the books. And the food is really good
This was on our meal plan so we decided to have lunch there. It was very busy had to wait a bit for food and seats. I had a rib and chicken combo that came with potatoes, corn and a drink. It was very good. 
We had Breakfast here , the setting is great but let down by the food, worth a visit but be openminded when it comes to the food choice .
We went to the Three Broomsticks for dinner at about 7 pm. We were a party of 5 adults and decided to order The Great Feast Platter. It was worth it and it took us some effort to finish all the food. As for drinks, like most reviewers, I preferred the Frozen Butterbeer. If you are a beer drinking go for the Wizard's Brew or Dragon Scale.
This is sort of a must when visiting the wizarding world of Harry Potter if you want to embrace the entire Harry Potter experience.Much attention paid to details, decor, staff costumes, menu obviously ! Those turkey legs are a sight (and a great smell) in themselves. You can buy the butterbeer ice cream here, however in a cup, not available in a cone as in Fortescu's in Diagon alley. Ambiance was awesome! Lovely terrace at the back for more intimacy and a great view of the stars in the evening.
you wouldn't think theme park food would be really good but the chicken dinner at the three broomsticks is very good 
We were so lucky to walk right in, order and find a table for four. We had a late lunch around 3:30 pm. Really enjoyed the Salad with Chicken and the Fish and Chips. On another trip to Universal we were also lucky to walk in at the tail end of Breakfast and were served a delicious meal. The staff was super both times. Highly recommend stopping here to experience it for yourself.
We've decided to have lunch at three broomsticks and were really surprised. My wife had the half chicken and I tried the fish and chips. Both were really tasty and the atmosphere was like being in the Harry Potter movie.
I always have to make a stop for lunch or dinner at the Three Broomsticks! The theming is fantastic, if you are a fan, you will love every minute of it! The food is delicious and you can always top it off with a butterbeer (get the frozen kind! it's the best!) For large groups, they even have a grand feast, a little bit of everything, enough food to feed a family.
Given the theming you would expect the prices here to be higher but they are pretty much comparable to other locations in the park. Mainly 'British dishes' - fish & chips, cottage pie, Cornish pasties etc. Portion sizes are a little on the small side compared to other places though. The only real pain is that they don't do any standard drinks - just Butterbeer, pumpkin juice, lemonade etc all of which are typically more expensive than a coke etc. On the plus side, staff will seat you here once you have your food so there is no need for one party member to go table hunting while the other orders.
I believe the man's name was David. He was the host in front of the restaurant dealing with a long line of people and answering questions non stop. He was the sweetest man and despite having to interact with thousand of people all day, he didn't make us feel like we were bothering him. I wrote a previous review stating how unfriendly and rude a lot of the employees we encountered at Universal. He was the exception. He belonged at Disney. He assured us that although the line looked long, it was only a half hour wait, and he was right. He explained the ordered procedure and that we wouldn't have to scramble for a table. When you have your food tray, the employees find a table for you and your family. I had the bbq chicken which was good, but my daughter did not like the turkey leg. Food average overall, prices reasonable.
Only downfall was world of harry potter don't drink pop so we had to choose lemonade. Food was good tho. My son loved it as well.
The food was good but it was the atmosphere that we really went for. it was very crowded though so going when its slower would be a good idea.
We only paid $45 but that's due to two frozen butterbeers. It was only 13 and 15 for our meals and it's really not bad considering we were at an amusement park. I throughly enjoyed my dinosaur (turkey) leg and my wife enjoyed her shepherds pie and loved that she had lamb in there as well. Definitely a place to stop by in HP world.
I love that you order your food, get your food, and are then seated by a hostess. At THE OTHER PLACE in town you must fight for your seat. Food is average, the cold butter beer was delicious but very sweet. $120 for four adults and two kids, which I thought was pretty good for theme park food. 
Service was incredible. Food was good for a mass produced food product for large groups with no chefs love. Environment was excellent. Overall experience was very good knowing we would be getting gouged by a park. Overall, the experience was good dropping the curve for a park.
We love this place! The food is excellent. Tasty and well seasoned. I especially love the fish and chips as well as the ribs. It is a hearty meal and generous portions. The iced tea here is insanely good!
We stopped in here for lunch with the family this afternoon. I got the Sheppard's Pie. Glenn got the chicken and spare ribs platter. Landon got the kids chicken tenders. We wrapped it up with a round of butter beers. One if the best things about this stop once you have gotten and paid for your food the host/ess seats you!! That's right no fighting for a table in the middle if summer!! 
Good meals, we ordered several different meals with a family of four and shared. Fish is excellent. Sit around back and get a view of the Castle.
Line is long, choices are poor, food is lousy. Atmosphere is cool but it doesn't make the food taste better. Go elsewhere!!!
My son wanted to eat here recently as he loves Harry Potter. As many of the reviews say, it is pretty much a fast food establishment and the choice is limited. However, it is friendly, well organised and what you are served is fine. I had the chicken and ribs and enjoyed it. I would rate the food a 3 to be honest but the adjoining pub has pushed my rating to a 4. It is a small fun pub with a snorting pig behind the bar, what is there not to like about that. The kids enjoyed it too which is the main thing.
I cannot rate the food above a 3/5 as it's mass catering standard quality. However, We sat down within 3 minutes of ordering and the place is extremely well organized.
"I ate the Fish and Chips meals and it was delicious, but, just like everything else in the park, it was quite expensive. Most surprising was that my bottled ""gillywater"" was over $5 for 16 oz, and it really wasn't anything but plain bottled water."
If you're a Harry Potter fan you must eat here. The food is good, service is pretty fast and friendly. We haf rotisserie chicken which was moist and very tasty.
Enter and order. Pick up your food. Once you have the food, a host/ess with take you to a table and remove the ''reserved'' sign. Signs are to keep people from plopping down to save seats. Respect the system. Some seating outside and in the Hog's Head pub. If you get beer or wine in the Pub, find the back of the line and you will be taken in turn. Don't miss the snorting warthog head behind the bar. Fish and chips were excellent and enough to share. Butterbeer, Guiness and basic wine available.
Park food in general can be less than great. Both the Three broomsticks and The Leaky Cauldron were above average food at fair prices. Fish and chip were exceptional!. Both places are great when you are in the parks looking for some decent food.
Three Broomsticks is located in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. It has a cool atmosphere, like being in a Harry Potter movie. When we first got there, we tried to reserve a table for the 8 of us, and then we found out that they have a system. First you order your food, then you pick up your food, and meanwhile they set up a table for you. It's actually quite organized. I decided to get the feast for four. For $48, we had a fresh salad, roasted corn on the cob, roasted fresh vegetables, like carrots, broccoli, potatoes, peppers, and mushrooms, chicken, sausages, and ribs! It truly was a feast! We enjoyed our meal, and I felt it was well worth the price.
"If you are a true Harry Potter fan, you have to eat at the Three Broomsticks! As a Harry Potter fan, you will love to soak up the decor as you dine. As well, it is great to sit in the nice cool cavernous room and get out of the Orlando heat. We were at the park on a very busy July day and chose to eat lunch at 11:30 before there were any line ups. The door attendant said that on busy days, there was usually a line up from about 12:30 until after 2:00. The service is quick and efficient, and they don't want any of your party members to 'save a seat', but will find you a seat once you have your trays of food. This helps the whole process go efficiently.The cost isn't outrageous and the portions are decent. We had the chicken and ribs that comes with corn on the cob and potato wedges. A family sitting nearby had the 'Platter', which was about $53 and had lots of food - we would have bought this if our kids were with us! Overall, the food was tasty for what is essentially a glorified cafeteria. Definitely worth the ""Harry Potter"" experience."
Ate here for a quick lunch. Pretty good Fish n' Chips for an amusement park. Wife had Chicken and Ribs. I had a bite and it was pretty tasty. The corn on the cob was good and not soggy as were the roasted potatoes. We have been here before about 3 years ago and it is still good. 
Three broomsticks was a good quick service lunch on the universal meal plan. Definitely get the roasted chicken! Apple pie wasn't bad either and will feed 2-3. Atmosphere is fun...there's always a line but it moved quickly!
We love Three Broomsticks! This is our absolute favorite amusement park restaurant as we feel it is the best we've had in a park since the food is delicious. The portions of the food are good size for the price. I've had the chicken that comes with corn on the cob and potato wedges and the fish and chips-both great! I would highly recommend to get your butter beer inside the restaurant to beat the long lines at the kiosks outside. They are very efficient with ordering and ushering you to an open seating. There usually is a wait, but it goes by pretty quickly. It is located right in Harry Potter World as you walk in from the entrance on the left, next to the restrooms. The service was professional, friendly, quick, and efficient. Every time we go to Universal, this is where we eat!
The service was fast but the food was a let down. Not only was my chicken cold it was undercooked in some areas. The table next to us had the same problem. The frozen butter beer was delicious and refreshing on such a hot day.
This was our 2nd time having lunch here. Once again, we ordered the Family Feast for Five. For $63 it is a complete meal excluding drinks and serves plenty for all. Quality of food was very good. 
Went for lunch and was so impressed with all the detail in the restaurant. It felt very real. The food was wonderful and very fast service. For being right in the park the prices were really reasonable. 
We love eating at Three Broomsticks each time we visit Islands of Adventure. The atmosphere is very charming and the food is better than most quick dining restaurants. 
Went here for breakfast and ordered a full English. Drinks not included. Cost nearly $40 It was cold and the beans were vile. The coffee was good. You pay for the experience rather than the food. We're we were sat we could hear the house elf bumping and crashing around upstairs. 
This is a very popular restaurant for good reason, the food is reasonably priced for a restaurant inside a park and it si flipping awesome. We got the feast for 4, which includes 4 full corn on the cobs, 4 quarter chickens, 2 full racks of ribs, roasted potatoes and broccoli and carrots all served after they give you a huge bowl of salad to get started on.The chicken is rotisserie and super good, the ribs fell off the bone and the corn was roasted as well. So very good, I highly recommend going here. The feast is only 45 dollars and could serve about 6 people, so the value is excellent. Also, on the way out, stop by the bar and get a butter beer...frozen of course!!!
Great selection, good prices and great staff. I requested a desert suggestion and butter beer ice cream was it. It is great!!
This is ok food for an amusement park. Probably a little better then average. Still way over priced for what you get. Decent chicken. 
If you are a Harry Potter then you know you have to come here! Ecxellent food! Excellent service! We used our dining plan here! Butterbeer!
This was a great place for breakfast .The whole family enjoyed the experience and the decor and feel to the place was great.
Good set up, my daughter (13) said they were the best fish and chips she has ever had. Family friendly and quick serviceability, but smallish portions
Good meal, but the main attraction to me was the atmosphere of the wizarding world. We had a good meal that was superior to the options of pretzels and other food not in restaurants.
We had butterbeer and 3 different meals. All were a bit dry and unlovingly put on the plate. Perhaps our timing was off but we werent impressed with the lunch. The decor was great and a really worthwhile thing to see. Fun costumed staff but no smiles. Would not return. 
The food is good here where the main courses are barbecued chicken and ribs. The chicken and ribs are very good. On a prior visit we ordered the Great Feast which included salad,corn, chicken and ribs. That was just right for 3 adults and 2 kids ages 10 and 7. At around $40 or so not including drinks,it was a great deal in 2013. On this Visit there were only two adults and now my kids are 13 and 10. Preferences change and so do prices. The Great Feast is around $50 not including drinks which I think is still a great deal given how much food you get. However, we opted for plates with less food. The tab was close to $50 or more but the important thing is that food didn't go to waste. We ordered a chicken and ribs plate and an extra kids plate from the kids menu. The food was still very good. The only negative is that there was a long wait to get inside to order food which made us feel like we were waiting to get onto one of the park rides. A very busy and popular restaurant. You may want to consider eating there just prior to or just after the peak lunch hour or just before or just after the peak dinner hour. 
We had a breakfast here and an early supper. Both were very good. Our family of 4 (2 adults, kids age 11 & 13) had more than enough to eat. We had the quick service dining plan (1 quick service meal, a beverage and 1 snack per day per person) and did the Harry Potter package which also included a breakfast here and at the Leaky Cauldron. This was more than enough food for all of us for our 3 days at the park. (We did have one evening meal off property). There was food left over both here and at the Leaky Cauldron. Would highly recommend this restaurant.
Good food some gluten free table sitting. Order and pick great place to eat as you are right in the area of the Harry Potter Castle 
"We ate around 7pm and got the ""four person"" family platter that easily fed two adults and four kids age 8 to 13 for about $50 (great price for on property). We stopped for butterbeer earlier in the day and spied the great family platters. The chef had to ""prepare"" the platter and deliver it to our table but I could see that all the family pre-made sitting in batches behind the counter. Would've most likely been better food quality if we'd have eaten earlier in the day. The platter included four large ears of corn, a full rotisserie chicken cuts into quarters, a rack of ribs and pile of steamed vegetables. Drinks were not included. The water we asked for was filtered so it tasted good."
We had breakfast here, it was included in our package. It is expensive. If we had purchase breakfast our self,, it would have cost $43.00 for 2
You order your food then they bring it up and you carry your stuff and find your own seat. We had the English fare breakfast it was ok.
We didn't get to have lunch or dinner here, but the breakfast was awful. Literally saw them squeezing eggs out of a clear, plastic bag into a warming pan and it tasted like nothing. We tried various plates, and very disappointed. Pancakes were ok. I'd steer clear of the breakfast and try the lunch. But... amazing decor and architecture! You should visit as it seems very authentic to the HP story, but they need to step it up on quality of breakfast big time.
The food prices here are not that unreasonable. Breakfast lines move faster than lunch or dinner. You will probably wait about 15 minutes for lunch, but the experience is well worth it. They offer typical British food (fish and chips, Shepard's pie) and a kids menu. I would recommend eating here, if just for the experience.
We ate breakfast three times here during our stay. I was a bit apprehensive about eating at the park for breakfast, but we loved this place. A little tip……..for the smaller appetite order a kids breakfast. It is plenty of food for an adult and almost as much food, and you can still get a coffee! The potatoes are really yummy.
I Went here with my children this past May. We ate here twice. I got two meals one roasted chicken with roasted potatoes and corn on the cob and potato wedges and one kids chicken finger kids meal was more than enough food for all four of us and was only about twenty something dollars. The food is actually really good and I am picky. I think much better quality than Disney food which I think is horrible and over priced. Absolutely recommend this place! 
Pumpkin fizz was a lot tastier than the beer. Food portions were quite large and affordable given themepark prices.
We had lunch at three broomsticks. The food was good, nothing wrong with it, nothing to write home about. We found it to be expensive & the ordering/pick up process similar to some other counter service locations throughout the parks, disorganized. It was good to get out of the heat & sit down in the wizarding world environment. In hindsight, we might walk through to look around and choose to eat elsewhere. 
This place is a MUST for Harry Potter fans. Don't let a long line discourage you - this place is run like a well-oiled machine! You will have placed your order, picked up your food and a staff member will have you seated at a table before you know what hit you. I was so impressed! My teenage boys (who can EAT) had the smoked turkey legs, and I had the pasties. Delicious! 
Not just good for theme park food, it was delicious for real! The Sheperd's Pie was good and the chicken and ribs meal was fantastic!
Its not about the food its about being in the Three Broomsticks. The price is more then it should be and the food is a two and a half out of five. You are there to be immersed in Potter.
While it has a very similar menu to the Leaky Cauldron, the Three Broomsticks isn't as nice a restaurant. The seats are uncomfortable being so low down (and I'm not small). It was very dark (even though it was midday), and there were flies buzzing everywhere. Unlike the Leaky Cauldron, the food isn't served to you at your table - you collect it after you order it, and have to get the cutlery, napkins, etc., yourself. The food isn't as great either. So between the Leaky Cauldron and the Three Broomsticks, the first has to win hands down. 
We grabbed a quick bite to eat at this restaurant at Universal Studios. The service was pretty good and we received our food quickly. The menu isn't great, but if we wanted a quick meal and then get back to the attractions. We had fish and chips and a turkey leg. Both came with fries. The cool thing about the seating is they tell you where to sit and you don't have to worry about finding a seat our fighting others for one. A nice relaxing environment to get a quick bite to eat. 
This little pub was the perfect sit down when in Hogsmead! It is just like the film, and you can buy British food! I loved the atmosphere and would recommend any potter fan pop in! Even just for a butterbeer!
We went there for dinner and ordered the smoked turkey leg, shepherd pie and fish & chips. The smoked turkey leg was very salty. The best was the fish & chips which my son ordered. Normally he does not like fish at all and the fact that he finished it is a sign that it was good. Other then that, the foos here at best is only average.
The food at the three Broomsticks was very good and the service staff was friendly. I would recommend this restaurant while in the park. 
We had two different types of breakfast, one with pancakes and sausage and one with egg, potatoes and bacon/sausage (I think, see picture below). It was very tasty and nice, very nice inside also, although a bit cold.
We had lunch at this restaurant during our visit to Universal Island Of Adventure. The food was absolutely delicious. Even though the line was pretty long it was moving fast. The food is more like a homemade food, not a fast food and it tasted fantastic! The price was affordable for the meal with drinks for 3 person we have payed a bit more than $50
We have visited Universal 3 times in the past 12 months from NC. We eat here for dinner every time! The ribs, roast chicken, potatoes and corn cob platter is the best! Their homemade vinaigrette salad dressing is my favorite part of the meal. Don't pass this place up on your next or first visit!!
I'm a Harry Potter fan so really enjoyed this experience, we stayed onsite so had early entry to the park so it was lovely and quiet when we got here. Ordered with no line to wait in and seated straight away. An adult plate and Childs plate was more than enough between us, we left some as couldn't eat it all! I loved the pumpkin juice(it's very sweet and cinnamony) not my hubby's taste but he likes black coffee which TBH wasn't great here. 
Now. Keep in mind, we came to Three Broomsticks for breakfast so you get your typical pre cooked in large batch eggs. But the experience was great. My husband got the traditional english platter which, i highly recommend. The treats on that plate were so good, wish I had gotten it. And of course, butterbeer :D 
The American breakfast was average and consisted of buttermilk pancakes and breakfast potatoes. We liked the Leaking Cauldron because they offered an oatmeal apple flan tjat came with yogurt and fruit which was tasty. Butter beer is also on the menu along with other beverages.
The line moves quickly even at peak meal times. Food is WAY too expensive for the quality of the food. The photos do not show what you're actually going to get. Atmosphere was neat, butterbeer was on par, but generally disappointed in the food/value.
A fun place to stop in and have lunch while in Hogsmeade especially if you're a Harry Potter fan. We ordered their fish & chips and butterbeers. Food was ok, not too bad for a quick meal in between rides. 
Our family got the Feast for Four and it was very good. The chicken was just a touch dry, but it had good flavor. The ribs, corn, potatoes and vegetables were excellent. The butterbeer was always yummy! Although none of us loved the pumpkin fizz. It is a very busy restaurant at lunch time. 
This is great food offering feasting menu options. It's a quick service restaurant where you pick up your food after you order but are seated by the staff. It's a little on the higher priced side but is very good. I recommend the bbq ribs, roasted corn on the cob and potatoes platter.
I had a lighter lunch of Cornish Pasties and Salad while my son had the chicken meal (included corn on the cob and roasted potatoes). They have examples of the meals for you to look at while you are waiting in line. There is approximately 10 different choices or so. You are directed to a cashier to place your order and then to a pick up window. The staff will find a table to you so you are not wandering around looking for a place to sit with a handful of plates. The chicken was plenty of food for the boys!
Terrible what more do I need to say really ?? The food was so poor thrown on the plate, cold properly the worst meal iv ever had and it was not cheap !
You wait in line, then order at the counter, then pick up your food. From there, enjoy being immersed in HP's world and eating yummy British grub! We LOVED it and loved the iced butterbeer too! 
We ate here twice for breakfast during our visit to Universal because we enjoyed it so much. Really the only downside to it is that the food is quite expensive (about $18 for breakfast). The first day my husband and I shared one american breakfast, which was plenty for us. The portion was quite large with bacon, sausage, eggs, potatoes, tomatoes, and a croissant. It also came with a drink. The second day we got the american breakfast and my husband wanted to try the english breakfast. We liked the american one better but they were both good and very filling. The food is much better quality than I would have expected. We had no problem getting seated in the morning. We went on a few rides first right when we got to the park and then went for breakfast and there were no lines either day. The place is very well themed so its a fun place to sit in if you are a Harry Potter fan. If you have time it is worth stopping in here to try their breakfast.
Average food, rotisserie chicken and bbq ribs...you are there mainly for the experience of dining in the halls of Hogwarts. Of course in a kids point of view this would be more than average . There is also a bar and serves alcoholic beverage other than Frozen Butterbeer so it's not all that bad
If you are planning to have lunch there, plan to go early, preferably around 11, if you do not want to wait for quite a whileThe food is fine, but the price of a bottle of still water is VERY expensive, over $4!
I booked a reserved breakfast here within a Universal theme park package. All of us had read all the Harry Potter books so we were excited to try this place which was mentioned in the books. We had a choice of several breakfasts. Two of us chose the traditional English breakfast which included scrambled eggs, two kinds of sausage (we did not like the black pudding which is a very dry sausage), a grilled tomato, beans, breakfast potatoes, and an English muffin. Two people ordered Butterbeer as their beverage which was also included. The ambiance was authentic to the HP book's description. There are very few breakfast options at Universal so be prepared to pay about $16 per person here. It was crowded but fun.
Pretty cool looking place. Food was alright. About what you'd expect at a mom and pop joint. Butterbeer was awesome.
This was our second visit in 3 years to Islands of Adventure and we couldn't wait to stroll through Hogsmeade again. Without a doubt, lunch or dinner at Three Broomsticks is a must-do. There's something so rustic & appealing about the atmosphere that Universal has created at Three Broomsticks. So much so, that one feels supremely satisfied sharing a platter of Chicken & Ribs with potatoes & corn on the cob. We did not order dessert this time but, as is the custom, a frozen Butterbeer will always bring out a smile & a sigh of contentment!
We ordered the family feast and were not disappointed. The meal gave each person ribs, chicken, grilled vegetables, and corn on the cob. It was enough to fill up 4 adults, and have food left.
This is mass food production, so if you go in with realistic expectations you won't be too disappointed. We tried the English breakfast and it was plenty of food for two people with a small appetite. 
The food was very good and the atmosphere was amazing. The line seemed long at first but the system in place moves you in and to your table quickly. The quality and portions were a great value for your money. 
Portions were very large. 2 adults can split one entrée. We like the bacon and the breakfast potatoes. Coffee was not great. Sit outside and enjoy a great view of Hogwarts castle.
The food is a little average and pricey but it's worth a trip for the atmosphere even if you only have a butterbeer.
My family of 4 always gets the great feast. It comes with chicken, ribs, potatoes, corn, vegetables, and salad, all for $50. This may seem expensive, but for theme park prices, you get a lot of food for the $50. There was so much food, we threw about 1/3 away. My description will not even do it justice, it is the best food I have had at a theme park (excluding special Disney restaurants). 
We had lunch at Three Broomsticks on a recent trip to Universal. My daughter wanted to try Butterbeer and the menu looked interesting. We had a party of 8 so we ended up having to sit outside which did not thrill us in 95 degrees but it was ok. I had the fish and chips, my husband had the spare ribs and chicken and my daughter had the mac and cheese. I liked my fish but the chips were soggy and not great. My husband liked the chicken ok but did not even eat the ribs as they were really dried out. The mac and cheese was ok. The biggest hit with my husband and Daughter was the butterbeer. We had one regular and one slush. I found it too sweet for me but they loved it. It was a fun experience to eat there but over priced (over $50) for lunch and the food was just ok. 
We had lunch and breakfast. The family feast is well worth the price if you have a three or four people to feed for lunch or dinner. The food is good, but it is more about the atmosphere. We loved it!!!
Good food and service, ate the chicken and ribs meal with the strawberry peanut butter icecream for dessert. Loved it all.
"We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of food here. Based on a recommendation from the park concierge, we went to both restaurants in the Harry Potter exhibits and loved them both. The food was tasty, and the theme of the restaurants fit the Harry Potter world. The ""salad"" that was a side salad was just a handful of mixed lettuce and greens, but again, expectations were set low since we were eating in a park."
Love to go both the Harry Potter restaurants. The food is really good and we all get into the theme. Definitely recommend.
"Let me just start off by saying, Yes I expect to be overcharged for mediocre food at a theme park... Having said that, this place was AWFUL. Having eaten at the Leaky Cauldron the day before I thought I knew what to expect. Nope. They had no kids menu visible anywhere and when I asked the cashier she said ""no not really"" so I ordered 3 turkey leg meals for my children and a Cornish pastie for myself. (Having lived in Britain I was foolish in assuming I had a vague idea as what I was going to get, wrong again). Paid the outrageous $75 for lunch and was then told I had to go stand in line to get my food... What???? So I stand in line..again... And am handed 2 trays with measly portions and then directed to go stand in line WITH MY FOOD at the hostess station to be directed to an available table. Finally we get seated, of course our food is barely warm and what I thought was going to be a cornish pastie actually resembles 3 very small pierogies and the salad is less than a cup, the children received less fries than they would in an order off the $1 menu at McDonald's, and decide they can't eat all the turkey leg, which I will say is enormous, too big for a child...hence the need for a kids menu!! I asked for a togo bag to take my $75 turkey legs with me and guess what... Nope, Nada, zippo... No togo bags, no plastic wrap, no wax paper. We spend plenty of time amusement parks, but this was the absolute worst!!! DO NOT EAT HERE..... there is no ""experience"" at this restaurant. However, I whole heartedly recommend the Leaky Cauldron!! "
"I enjoyed this restaurant. For a group of 6 we had the large feast and I had the sheperds pie which I really enjoyed. Didn't get to try the chicken but my family said it was ""ok"". The side booths are exactly like in the movies. The staff was really friendly as well. If you want to wash your hands or go to the bathroom you have to go to the only one in the area outside."
$16.95 for an English breakfast that looked like a poor copycat of a Denny's grand slam. The only highlight of my meal was the butterbeer albeit regular, not frozen. Breakfast prices are a ripoff. Lunch starts at 10:30 and I think the prices are a tad better. No question that the restaurant itself is a must-see for HP fans.
Wizard fans cannot pass up the chance to eat where so many important Potter moments occur. You will enjoy the décor and details of Three Broomsticks. We ate breakfast here as part of our Exclusive Harry Potter package, so we had a reservation and no additional out of pocket expenses. I did notice some people were able to walk right in; I guess it depends on how lucky you are on a given day. I booked the breakfast as late as possible to allow time for early park exploring before the crowds picked up. It was perfect because then we could sit down right away after our adventures. Everyone in our group ordered some combination of bacon, potatoes, pancakes, eggs, and croissants. You could order more traditional English fare. The food was fine (above average for park fare, particularly the bacon) but it was more about the experience. I liked that the employees pointed you to a table so you didn't have to wander, searching for somewhere to sit. Don't be shy about taking pictures!
We enjoyed our breakfast here. I had the English breakfast and it was pretty good. It was a little pricey for the quality of food but it is expected considering that it is in the park. They didn't offer a lot of drink options here. Harry Potter world is amazing to see and this place just added to the experience.
We had breakfast here and had made reservations ahead with our tickets. There was really no need for them, though. Great ambiance and wouldn't have missed the experience but the food wasn't anything to write home about. Two portions were cold and my daughter's pancakes were burned. Very nice about switching them out for us. Great bacon - nice & crisp!!The service style (tray pickup and self service seating) and food didn't compare to Leaky Cauldron, so if you can only do one, that should be your choice! If you don't end up eating here, make sure to go in to see how they reproduced it from the movies. As we experienced across the board in the parks, staff was friendly and very helpful!
We enjoyed eating lunch here on our second day and were pleasantly surprised at the price! Thank you!
Universal is not the best place in terms of quick service meals, but this place is an exception. The food is good and fresh, the ambient is great and the service is really good.
A lovely place, the sharing chicken/rib platter for 4 people was amazing and at $50 was excellent value as there was so much food!!! The staff were great, kept things moving and very friendly and helpful, the whole 'Harry Potter' theme is outstanding and can't wait for (hopefully!) a second visit.
Well, eating in the Three Broomsticks! What's not to like? If you are a Harry Potter fan this is a must do! I highly recommend the Butter Beer. 
Universal in-park food is, as a rule, quite bad but this was one of the few pleasant experiences for us. Great theming (and as such, expect long lines), decent menu selection and pretty good quality. Unlike it's sister restaurant in Diagon Alley even fussy eaters can find something to eat here. Of course being in the Harry Potter section you will not find any soda here - be prepared for that (Water, lemonade, pumpkin juice, butterbeer are available). One tip we found - the drinks were small and on a hot day we downed ours quickly. Waiting in the loooooong line to order was not feasible so we went to the Hog's Head Bar at the far end of the restaurant and they had (at least some) nonalcoholic drinks there as well with no line.
JK Rowling wouldn't feed her own children food from these HP themed restaurants. The food was very bland and way overpriced but did stay true to other Universal restaurants. The aesthetics was the only positive quality. Cafeteria style was also extremely disappointing. Watching them pour the $3 glasses of milk and juice from jugs and cartons at half that price was bad form.
Food is nothing to write home about and is overpriced, but hey, it's a theme park. The decor, however, is first rate! The designers definitely followed the movies in their creation of this place, and the time and care is evident. Go with the mindset that you're there for the experience and decor and not the food and you won't be disappointed.
This place looks like it's always packed, but the staff seem to have a great system for keeping things moving. The fish and chips were good, but the best part was the atmosphere.
Full marks to the 3 broomsticks for creativity in environment, atmosphere, service and overall experience. My wife and I had the chicken sandwiches which were nice, Our children had Toad in the hole and fish and chips which they enjoyed. To drink I had a fishy green ale which was the strangest drink I have ever had ( think 10p sweet mix as a drink ) I much preferred the frozen butter beer which is lovely! We ate at a couple of places at the universal parks and they seemed a little lighter on the pocket than Disney, The 3 broomsticks was very busy when we visited and portions are not huge but great for a quick fill up and worth a visit for a unique experience.
Best price/quality food for the two harry potter restaurants in Universal. Everything else isn't up to Disney standards except the two potter restaurants.
In Harry Potter’s world there are two eating establishments most people seem to visit, the Three Broomsticks and Hogsmeade.Because there were six of us, we ordered the Great Feast Platter.Very tender BBQ ribs, very tender baked chicken, tons of sliced red potatoes and onions, fries, two over sized ears of corn and two large drinks. I ordered an additional drink call dragon scales, which was a great tasting stout beer. This was more than enough to feed our crew of six. However, just as samples, we also ordered fish and chips, shepherd's pie, macaroni cheese, chocolate trifle and several glasses of Butter beer. Butter beer is nothing more than caramel colored cream soda. Butter beer is great for the kids.Because this is a real restaurant, people come and go in and out of costume. Eating in this rustic tavern is like eating in the films. A vast amount of attention to detail went into recreating this venue. Too cool!
This is tough to get into, so go early. They have delicious ribs, rotisserie chicken, turkey legs, roasted potatoes- good, corn on the cob- not so sweet, but they do big volume.
We loved this place! We had to wait about 15 minutes for a party of 5. It was worth the wait! We had awesome seating in a perfect little book by the window. The food is delicious! I have never seen the movies but I absolutely loved the restaurant. Can't wait to go back!
Popped in for quick breakfast after a ride on Gringotts! Tasty breakfast good price and quick service. All Harry Potter themed. Would return
Walking in was just like what I imagined from reading the books. The decor was spot on and it was busy and bustling with people - most with Harry Potter robes on. Depending on the time that you go, there might be a long wait. Unless you go at opening time, there will always be a wait, just longer at peak times. I went at midday the first time and waited almost 45mins, but went at 11am the next day and only waited 5mins, so definitely be choosy about your timing!The food is very British inspired, and of course offering butterbeer. I had the shepherds pie, which was really delicious and went well with the cold butterbeer. 
I really didn’t do my homework here, because if I knew that this place was a cafeteria type of restaurant, I would have ventured to the leaky cauldron, instead of the broomsticks. The food was okay, and it honestly kept my wife and I satisfied, even though we shared a chicken platter that included roasted potatoes and an ear of corn. We also ordered a frozen butter beer here, simply because they told us that we would get free refills, but as we learned quickly, you don’t need that cup to have your water refilled, and ditched the idea of drinking soda, in lieu of water, because of how hot the weather was. Not to get too far off track here, at the cafeteria, you place your order, then go to counter that has the same number that you placed your order at to pick up your food. You are then ushered into a huge community dining hall, where you are seated by the usher. I liked this, because there was no one trying to “hold” tables while people were sitting in line.
We had a lovely lunch in Three Broomsticks and were pleasantly surprised by the reasonable prices. We ordered two meal plans for $20 each and had two nice plates of food that fed our family of three easily and the meal plan had an extra drink and snack that we enjoyed later in the day.One plate was fish and chips and the other was Chicken and Ribs. Both plates had plenty of food and the quality was good (not great, but who expects great at a theme park) also. I had pear tea for my drink and it was very refreshing.... Wanted to bring some home. The atmosphere was hard to beat also, felt like we were eating in a place right in hogwartz.... Thank you Three Broomsticks for the nice meal and great atmosphere
We asked the gal working in Olivanders where to eat. She suggested the 3 broomsticks. We ordered the feast expecting to need snacks later but we did not. It was more than enough food for a family of 4. My hard to please, foodie husband was even sated. The meal starts with a large simple salad. The chicken and ribs were done right. Not overly salty. The red potatoes and corn on the cob were plentiful. This also came with steamed broccoli, carrots and red peppers. There was so much we couldn't finish the meal. Best amusement park meal I've had to date. Didn't miss the dry stale burger and day old fries. Best $49 I have spent. That was $11.50 a person!! Not too bad when you have to feed a teenage boy as well.
doing the whole Harry Potter thing, so had to eat somewhere like this & to be honest it was a great experience. The menu was ok, seeing some of the food as we queued helped. There was quite a queue when we arrived, but is was well managed & we were quickly pointed to our nominated cashier. After getting our food we were then pointed to a table - this was brill, as it took away the need to fight & scrap to get a table....all done for you. Quick & efficient & done with a smile. we all went for fish & chips & there were v nice. the lager was a but strange - glad I stuck to a soft drink. The portions were more than enough to fill is up. Good chips & 3 or 4 good size meaty fish goujons.all in all a very nice lunch & kept us going for another 4 hours !!!!
Nice selection of breakfast options. A little expensive for the portion sizes and variety. Excellent quality food though. Would definitely recommend!
The English breakfast was very much like what Harry would have had for breakfast. Didnt like the black sausage much though.
The food was authentic to England and very yummy! There were tons of options to choose from. I had the fish and chips and they were great!
Although this is the same food as over in the Leaky Cauldron, this was our very first stop on our 4 day experience at Universal and we LOVED it! Everyone there was incredibly friendly...we had a reservation and we were treated wonderfully (maybe because we were the first ones there and it hadn't gotten crazy yet?). Our experience at the Leaky Cauldron the next day wasn't nearly as fun. American fare available as well as the English breakfast. It's definitely a high protein breakfast. We did not eat there any other time so no opinion on the food the rest of the day.
The meat pies and pastries are good! My daughter loves the fish and chips, and my wife and I enjoy the Shepard's Pie! Please note that it has rows shared tables with an Old English Tavern!
We had to eat here, just for the sake of following the movies. Food was American with an English fare. Spendy but set up like you would imagine and they move you rather quickly.
Food was nice, que was very long but was a very nice experience. My brother wasnt very pleased how there wasn't any soda just the fizzy orange lemonade or bottled water but think it was them trying to keep within the whole harry potter three broomstick concept and I didnt mind it ☺
This restaurant is a must for fans of the Harry Potter series. The food was surprisingly excellent and the portions were large for such a great value. The details inside made you feel as if you were sharing a meal with your friends while on a Hogwarts school trip into Hogsmeade.
We purchased the Harry Potter Vacation package for Universal Studios Orlando and with it came a breakfast at the Three Broomsticks. I had the pancakes which were very good.
"We recently went to Universal and knew we wanted to try an ""authentic looking"" restaurant while in HP land. We waited about 15-20 minutes to order our food, but were seated quickly after getting our food. I ordered the fish and chips--very good! My husband/child shared the ribs/chicken with corn and potatoes. I also ordered corn. The fish and chips were the best--very authentic and tasted like what I'd had in England. The frozen butter beer was really good too. We sat in the bar area--across from the Boars Head! The restaurant was a nice place to get out of the sun, but it was overpriced for what you got to eat, or at least I thought so."
It was amazing! Had fish and chips, they were crunchy and fresh! Had the very distinctive Butter beer.Our waitress was a delight, and made my birthday super fun!
We loved everything that had to do with Harry Potter! This is a must see if you're a fan! We tried the Butterbeer and would like to try the frozen kind next time.
The interior of the Three Broomsticks was interesting and it definitely looked the part. It is big and we had no problem finding a table for lunch. The service was fairly quick and there were several lunch options.The food was OK. The highlight of the meal was the Butter beer.
We had breakfast reservations on a Friday morning for 17. It really was okay but not great. The best part was getting to see the hogs head move. You go in and everyone orders one at a time then goes to the corresponding line that matches the cashier number you originally ordered from. Food was okay to mediocre depending on what you ordered.
Very good food! My wife (being sometimes a bit picky) found the fish'n'chips delicious and fresh, made with not overused fat (which is sometimes the case in restaurants in parks). My chicken was tasty, too. 
My family and I finally got into the Harry Potter movies during our most recent trip to Florida so we couldn't wait to get to Universal Studios to check out everything Harry Potter. We weren't disappointed! We had decided to try out 3 Broomsticks for dinner while we were there and we ordered the great feast for our family of 4 which was delicious and also tried the butter beer. We've already decided we can't wait to come back and do it all over again.
The food here was great! Perfectly themed and delicious!As a side note, I spoke to the Head Chef due to a food allergy. He personally came out to talk to me the day before and assured me all would be well when we came back the next day. When we returned, he recognized us by the order, came and spoke to us again, and personally prepared our food to made sure there was no cross-contamination! Out of all the restaurants I have dined at, NONE have been so accommodating! HE WAS FANTASTIC!!
The best meal we have had at any of Orlando attractions. Ribs and chicken with corn on the cob to die for. Thanks guys for a great visit. Have to say the ladies that seated us all really well organised and very friendly and helpful thank you 
We enjoyed eating here one day. Interesting food selection, quick service and the food was much better than expected. Prices were reasonable considering you are at a park. 
While at the Wizarding World, this is a must visit! The traditional english breakfast was delicious and the staff makes dining fun!
The three of us all enjoyed our meals. Ordering process can be a little hectic with so many people around, but extra staff helps direct you to numbered register and available seating for your party. We liked the food presentations in the case prior to ordering as it helped us make our decision with some unfamiliar menu items. This was our second visit and it was as good as the first.
You are taken into Harry Potters world!! Young or old you cannot help but feel as if you are traveling on your nimbus 2000 with Harry and his friends
The wait time can be long unless you go early for lunch (11:00 am maybe) or much later in the day and avoid the supper crowd, too. We love the fish and chips (at least the fish which has never been frozen and is flown in) Ask for the Butterbeer ice cream! It is fantastic!!!
Our family of 4 dined here for lunch. We ordered the Great Feast. The platter is massive! It includes a whole chicken cut in quarters, ribs, a family sized salad and veggies. This meal was the best value of all the meals we had at Universal Studios. We even had leftovers which ended up eating for dinner.We sat on the patio and had a great view of the park. One recommendation is to order and grab a table before noon if you're looking to have lunch here. It fills up quick and the line can sometimes be out the door. 
A little pricey, the food was ok. The chicken and ribs with potatoes and corn were good. The cornish pasties were served with a small salad and everything was fresh. Not much meat or veggies in the pasty filling and I could only taste paprika.Not really easily accessible for wheelchairs and it is a noisy restaurant. 
My daughter and I ate breakfast at the Three Broomsticks and it was just okay. We shared the American breakfast which came with eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes and a croissant. It was a bit expensive (20.00) but there was enough food for both of us. The eggs were not the greatest and it was typical fast food. If you like Harry Potter then you will enjoy the atmosphere.
It was just perfect. My wife and I split the chicken and ribs, 4 ribs, 1/4 chicken, roasted potato and corn. Plenty! And Good! No soda option , ice tea , lemonade, beer, butter beer etc. it was straight out of the book cute
I was here with a group of friends, and we loved it. The atmosphere is very reminiscent of the movies, and they have the movie soundtracks playing while you eat. The food is pretty good for theme park food, with traditional English fare like fish and chips and cottage pie. It can get crowded in the afternoon (we ate around 2:30 and had to wait 15 minutes for a table), but the employees are very efficient at bussing tables and seating diners.
Everything about this place was like the book/movie. I wouldn't have imagined it any other way. The background sound, the workers, and the food was great! I loved the butterbeer! If only I could go back to on my vacation, I will go here again! 
The theming in this restaurant is terrific; it is a delight just to be there. But the food is a surprise, but given how much attention Universal has given to the whole Wizarding world, perhaps it shouldn't be a surprise at all. The food is of excellent quality, and the price point is relatively reasonable. It is a place for pictures and for your kids to feel a part of that world in fuller measure. Terrific, and worthy of a visit.
"First of all, you WILL be impressed by the Theming of this restaurant. The entire place is like the movie with touches of ""modernity"". You will feel like you are really in Hogsmeade dinning in the Three Broomsticks with a few twists.The menus are displayed clearly (limited offers) in a very nice animated screen that makes it look like its a moving picture/menu (effect like the movie).This is a fast food joint so you first see what you want, then you order and pay,then you get your food and then you get a seat assigned to you.During busy days you should always expect at least 15 minutes wait to order. The line moves fairly fast and is full of cast members ready to help you in any issue.We tasted different packages while we were here. I was disappointed by the Fish (fish and chips). The fish was incredibly bland and the sauce was definitively subpar. The chips were ok. In the other hand, the chicken and the BBQ packages are above average. So unless you cant eat meat, you should go for these.You can also order the huge 4 person platter that offers more food than most people can handle. Very good for sharing.Now the interesting part. After you order and get your food. You might be surprised to be stopped by one cast member in a small line.To make sure noone fights or wastes space (or even sit down to hoard a table with no food while others cant sit down), A staff member will always be screaming or asking to the other staffs (who are cleaning the tables) the number of seats needed. And you will get get assigned a table that fits you.Very efficient, Fast and you will get always a clean table this way!.Now in general terms, Id say I am disappointed by Universal Studios and IOA's food offers, which seem to be lower quality than Disney's average for the same price.Yet you can still find decent food in some areas like The Three Broomsticks."
My husband and I are Annual Passholders and we took his mother to Universal Orlando (both parks) to see the two areas of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Our lunch at Three Broomsticks was excellent. The restaurant was extremely crowded and people were waiting in line after receiving their food to be seated, but we walked outside to the open seating and found a good table there. The rotisserie 1/2 chicken with corn on the cob and roasted potatoes was a nice big lunch and everything tasted great. My mother-in-law had the fish and chips and she was very happy with her lunch too (portion and taste). We will definitely eat at this restaurant again.
The Three Broomsticks is fab if you want food - big tables, sensible queuing system and food looked great! We visited early afternoon and popped next door to the Hogs Head where we had drinks only and so the service was super quick! The cool, dark, calm atmosphere was a perfect place to relax after a busy morning in the park. Not to be missed though is the outside covered area which has a fabulous view of Hogwarts - and we had this to ourselves for a least an hour as it clearly a hidden gem. It isn't an inexpensive place to pop for drinks - but it has that fabulous Potter feel about it - and the outside terrace is amazing!
This was way more than I could expect for a theme park. I shared the Great feast with friends which was 50$ which sound pricey but it was way better than a 12$ hotdog. The food was delicious the only downfall is that you don't get free refills on drinks.
I didn't get any food, stupid me was standing at a little cart wanting butterbeer when a lovely employee told me there was no line at the 3 broomsticks! I jumped to action and raced over. Employees were super nice and made the whole exchange easy. 
Most of those who have visited Universal Studios in Orlando would agree that this is a great place to have lunch. There's a preset menu you can choose from and the food is quite good.Not to mention that you are in a Harry Potter environment surrounded by magic ;) Butter beer a pleasant surprise. I really liked that.
Always easy in and quick with the food. Extremely expensive for what they serve. Family of 4 can expect to pay 30-40 for breakfast. Twice I have had to return the meal because it was cold. Neat HP decor. 
I enjoyed the American Breakfast. The food arrived quickly and I enjoyed looking around and seeing all of the details. The staff was nice.
We read the reviews and expected more. Typical theme park fast food with bad service and food. The first problem was the weirdo guy Jack at the front with the menu. Get rid of him. We ordered salads next with coke. We go thru the line and pick up our meal. No cokes. She didn't bother to tell us they don't serve coke so we had to go to the bar in the back for water. They seated us next to a concrete support. We asked to be moved to one of the many open tables. They can't do that. Yea right. Then one of our party choke on an old dry roll. Run from this place. Go to Margaritaville at the City Walk. Ask for a cobb salad with fried chicken on top for about $14. The same as the nasty meal at Three Broomsticks. The food, service and scenery are so much better. I hardly ever give bad reviews but trust me you might want to avoid this place.
gets packed but well worth it to experience everything. when i go back i will be drinking here again.
I have eaten her before and have always enjoyed my meal. I'm not sure that I would get the Cornish pasties again, but they were good try once. Also, they're very wiling to fill your wear bottle; a must in the Florida heat.
We had the American breakfast at Three Broomsticks. It was scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes and a croissant and a beverage - we got the butterbeer. This was all included in our Harry Potter vacation package. The food was good and plenty of it. We also had the same breakfast meal on another day at Leaky Cauldron - it was exactly the same.
Yummm yummm and yummmm! Matched it with frozen butterbeer, ribs, chicken, vegetables and seasoned potato!!! Sooo good!
"We only ate breakfast here. Thankfully it was included in our package, because for four of us it cost $55!The eggs, bacon and pancakes were all great. When you're able to drink ""pumpkin juice"" or ""butterbeer"" with any meal, how can you go wrong?Harry Potter fans will be in their glory. You're paying for the experience, the memories and the ability to say ""I did that!"" the next time you read the books."
Even though the park was not really busy as it would be in the summer, there was a 10 minute Que but once you get to the food order point, the food was served very quickly. Lots of space and a great place to eat. I found the portions for their fish and chips a little small for the price but the pumpkin juice was lovely. 
"The title of this review sums it up pretty well. What is notable is that we're talking about a resort park dining venue! The restaurant, situated in the Harry Potter-themed section of islands of Adventure at Universal Resort, Orlando, is supposed to be a dining establishment in the English village that includes Hogwarts, the school for wizards. It resembles a huge, Old-English cottage/pub, with a very high sloping roof and room for several hundred diners. You might have to make a line to get to the register where they take your order; then proceed to pick up that order; then hopefully find a table inside or out. The food itself is remarkably tasty - even the chips or roasted potatoes, Portions are generous: e.g., 1/2 a chicken comes with potatoes and a whole corn-on-the-cob. Price is only $11.99. Fish & Chips is $13.99. You can also try the excellent Shepherd's Pie or Cornish Pasty - again, tasty and priced right. A family on a budget can easily feed two kids from one platter. I didn't try any desert, but if you are a Harry Potter fan, you might want to visit Honeydukes next door. I recommend you try the famous ""Butterbeer"" with your meal; it's served in a pint glass and is very refreshing. (Think cream soda with a head on it - only better.) Handicapped patrons are helped by the courteous staff - that's a big plus in this busy restaurant."
Loved our roasted chicken and rib platter with corn on the cob and what we call southern fried potatoes. Super delicious and plenty enough for my hubby and I to split the plate. I highly recommend the food. Plus you are transported to another place and time when dining inside this timbered building.
This is the Harry Potter restaurant and it actually feels as if you are eating in the restaurant from the movie. Keep an eye out for the special effects. The food is actually quite good - English pub fare and they also serve beer and butterbeer. The staff is friendly. You basically put your order in at one counter, get it at another and then they take you to your seat.Their salad was pretty good, I am blanking out on what I had for the main entree although I know that I enjoyed it and we had the trifle for dessert witch was yummy, My friend had the butter beer which he loved and I had a regular beer. We will definitely stop in here for lunch again, the next time we visit Florida.
"We had both breakfast and lunch at the Three Broomsticks. It is connected to the Hogs Head Pub, just like in the movie and books. The setting is beautiful, in the middle of Hogsmead. The food is good, and It's a nice way to eat something different than the standard ""park"" food (pizza, burgers, chicken fingers) that litter the rest of the park, but it's nothing outstanding or special. Prices are also fair for park food. Not cheap but also not expensive. In keeping with the theme, they don't serve regular sodas, just pumpkin juice, butterbeer, gilly water, and certain Harry Potter themed beers. We tried both the pumpkin juice and the butterbeer. The pumpkin juice was a strange mix... it tasted like a cold spiced cider mixed with pumpkin. We were not crazy about it, but I would strongly recommend getting the frozen butterbeer to drink on a hot day. It's absolutely delicious & my favorite part of the park!!We had the American Breakfast, with eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes & a croissant. For lunch we had the Rotisserie chicken that came with roasted potatoes and corn on the cob. Both meals tasted very good."
I eat here every time I visit. I have a pass so that is about once or twice a month. The food is delecious but it is a tad but pricey. I went in April and I think Butterbeer (Frozen) was almost $7) for one small cup
We ate breakfast here. They have both American (pancakes or eggs) & traditional english. Both were good. The decor is very good & you feel like you are in the movie. 
After a few weeks in the states, we were just excited to have food that reminded us more of home in Australia! The Fish & Chips were great, and I loved all the British-type food available. Butterbeer ice cream was also a hit!The staff are very efficient in getting you served and seated, but still expect a bit of a wait anywhere around lunch time (we went at 3pm and there was still a queue)
The fish and chips is amazing, you must try the Butter Beer! A little on the pricey side, but worth is.
This place is awful. The only thing palatable was the corn on the cob but kind of hard to screw that up. Should have known better but wanted son to enjoy the whole HP experience. Save your money and go anywhere in Citywalk.
What a fabulous experience! The set-up was awesome and the meals were fantastic! Loved that it was one price per adult meal (including food and a drink) and the another for child's and extra for drinks outside the meals. Would go again in a heart-beat :) 
Great set up, food came quickly out. Make sure you get a butterbeer with your meal! (If you go out the back door you have a great view of the castle) Staff are fantastic!
We ate lunch here, got seated right away. We sat outside. Our meals that we ordered were different than the meals at The Leaky Cauldron. We liked both places. Had more of the Butterbeer too. Would recommend highly.
Step into The Three Broomsticks and you will feel like you just stepped into the exact restaurant in Hogsmeade that Harry, Ron, and Hermione visited during the movies. The design of the restaurant was authentic, following the movie nearly identically. The food itself was tasty, though the Cornish pasties are pretty small (but fortunately served with a salad).
We ate lunch here one day during our vacation. Everyone from the man greeting us at the door to the person taking our order were very friendly. The service was quick and efficient. There was not a huge selection to choose from but both my girlfriend and I each found something. She had the shepherd's pie which she enjoyed and I had the roasted chicken which was quite good. We both loved eating outside at the tables by the water. Overall it was a good experience and would def et there again.
If you are reading this post, than more than likely you are not a Harry Potter fan and are looking for somewhere good to eat inside the park. This is a Harry Potter fan based restaurant and the main reason for going here is that experience. Let's talk food. Like most parks food nothing stood out as great, the ribs were ok at best, the chicken was dry, the fish and chips were actually pretty good. Better places to eat, unless you love HP.
I was pleasantly surprised by the prices and the food. This is not fancy dining, but it was fun to be in a HP-referenced establishment! There were 6 of us and between us we ordered the chicken fingers (3), fish and chips (2), and salad. It wasn't outrageously expensive, the tables and chairs were clean, the employees pleasant, the food was satisfying, and the atmosphere was great. I think 3.5 stars would be a good rating - I rounded up. 
O.M.G. The food here is TERRIBLE!!! I ordered the meat pasties, which was supposed to be ground beef, veggies, and potatoes baked in a flaky pastry. LOL!!! I can't even describe the awful taste of those three teeny tiny things! It was GROSS!! I had them change that out for the fish n chips, which were just...okay. I was super disappointed. I was more disappointed, though, that I had actually given them money for that nastiness. Blechhhh!! I will NEVER go there again!!!
Great atmosphere ,friendly staff. Large portion of food so it was with the wait. It was nice the staff was willing to take photos with us.
Overall, not tremendously impressed with the food, and the child portions were QUITE small- I should have just gotten an adult portion for my 8 year old. I will say, the interior of the Three Broomsticks was fantastic, and that was half the reason we wanted to eat there, though I am certain there was better food to be had in other parts of the park.
It came with our Universal package so limited on what you could order. The decorations in the restraint made it vey nice and service was excellent. We had pancakes and they tasted great but a little pricey if it would not have been included in our package but about average for theme parks
This is a great quick service restaurant to extend your Harry Potter experience. We used the Universal quick service dining plan so this was also a good value.
If you really must eat in the park, don't bother with this. Expensive, very ordinary. Chicken and ribs done badly. Why put up with this rubbish. 
Great experience to be had at the Three Broosticks. In my party we had the fish and chips, cornish pasties and chicken salad. All was good, the trifle in particular was excellent. The atmosphere was brilliant with the shadows a house elf and birds on the ceiling. The only small thing is the queue is always quite long as it's a popular place to eat. The people were great and we can't wait to go again. And of course the butterbear is a must!
We had our family lunch at this HP themed resatuarant. The ordering, paying and eating placements were all seamless as ushers guided us along the way (yes, eating there is like taking a ride with the queuing). For a theme park , the food was pretty good! 
We prepaid for a breakfast reservation. Which was really not a reservation like they said when we booked. All it meant was it was prepaid we still had to stand on line for a 30 minute wait!!!! After I checked in I was assigned to a line that would get me the food I ordered (we had to choose from 4 meals offered). the person tending to my line was laughing and joking in the kitchen while all the other lines moved along. Our food was cold and none of us ate it. Would not recommend. We also did the character breakfast which was much more enjoyable. 
Great decor and theme but overpriced average food. I think it's just what one would expect from a theme park restaurant and that's okay. Let yourself go and immerse yourself in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and you won't care much about the price and the food will taste better, too. 
This is a fun restaurant. The wait was about 30 minutes, but seemed to move fast. The service was good. The place could have been a bit cleaner, but I get that they are trying to move a lot of people in and out really quickly, and sometimes they don't sweep after every diner leaves. We got the Platter Feast for 4. It was large enough for the five of us, and was filling and it felt like we were eating healthy, which was nice. Everyone enjoyed their meal. The butter beer is expensive, but the kids loved them!
The Three Broomsticks is definitely a restaurant you have to eat at to get the most out of your Harry Potter experience. The coolest part about the whole restaurant are all the moving photos that are placed everywhere and at every angle. I had to sit and get a video of Sirius Black in his Azkaban photo. The food is also very delicious but if I had to pick a favorite I would say the fish and chips dish! You must also try the pumpkin juice. It is more of a dessert than a drink to accompany dinner so save it for last.
Great food in a casual atmosphere with Harry Potter theme. Love the food and of course butter beer! We ate here at least three times during our vacay and tried different meals each time. We loved it.
Well organized for ordering and seating. Wasn't too busy when we were there but looked like it could get very crowded. Lots of English food on the menus which is hard for a tween aged kid. Fish & chips became her go to food. Sticky toffee pudding dessert disappointed. 
First, the line at lunch was long, but it was well-managed and we got through as quickly as possible. This is one of the few counter service restaurants that has some healthy-ish options. The potato wedges were good -- better than I expected, and I was glad they were not fries! I had soup and salad. The soup was not out of a can. Not amazing, but I was just pleased to get soup and salad for $8 at an amusement park! The salad was a typical side salad. We also had a turkey leg, which was enormous but pretty salty. Overall, this was a great amusement park meal!The decor is great and it's worth going in just to see the interior. It's nice and cool inside, too.
Excellent food, service and ambience. We were pleasantly surprised at how speedy the line and service was. We enjoyed the food, and the bill for six adults and four children, was about $100. 
Shepherds pie and the chicken were amazing. Atmosphere was very much what I imagined it would be in Hogsmede
Food is very good; air conditioned and in the shade. Great place for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Portions are HUGE; the roast chicken is literally half a whole chicken. This is a must do for all HP fans! 
the Restaurant itself is like a movie set,.. amazing theming the food even though its quick service is quite good and original most of the food is British / harry potter inspired. its a nice break from the typical burgers and fries in most placesIf you love harry potter you have to eat here and imagine yourself in the movie.
The Harry Potter ride made me sick so I couldn't eat. The cool restaurant actually helped my upset stomach. Love the decor. Wish I could eat the raspberry chocolate desert!
We have very low expectations for theme park restaurants and this restaurant actually exceeded all expectations. The wait was what made me take one star off. We waited at least 40+ minutes in line before ordering. They have you line up outside and then disappoint you when they send you inside and you have another 20+ minute wait. Once you are past the wait, the food is good. We ordered the rotisserie chicken dish with potatoes & corn. The chicken was quite good! My daughter loved the ribs as well. Our favorite part of the lunch was the Butter Beer ice cream. SOOO good! A good experience here, I'd definitely recommend!
Eating here was just like eating at the actual place right out of the books. The attention to detail is just indescribable. If you a Harry Potter fan you must come here.
Had breakfast here and was not impressed by the food, service, or atmosphere. Tried a beer thinking it might brewpub good but it tasted like Budweiser.
Had a lovely, and surreal meal in the 3 Broomsticks. Menu is limited, but good quality. Plus you'll probably spend most of your time thinking about all the great witches and wizards who have dinned in here before you. Don't forget to have a butterbeer!
The food is excellent & large in portions! I had the fish & chips, while my mom had the pastries. We shared mac & cheese...yes we were gluttonous but it was so good! You will be paying resort/park prices so don't be alarmed. The children's portions are quite large! Don't forget your butter beer! The whipped topping is amazing. 
I do understand that your children want to eat here because they are all wrapped up in the HP world, but the food is really bad...especially for the price. My suggestion is to take pictures out front, then buy them a Butterbeer from the cart.
Great place to dine in the whole Harry Potter feel of being in the film. Had there Fish and Chips along with there Butter Beer! Go and enjoy!
We arrived here just before they switched to lunch menus, so it was reasonably quiet. The range of menus seems better than in the other park, since there was a delicious fruit breakfast on offer here that was delicious. Nice place to have a bite to eat, and pleasant staff.
I've never stood in so many lines to get food!!!For our family of 6, we got 6 meals & 6 butterbeers=$108. Our kids were such big Harry Potter fans that we splurged on this meal. The fish and chips plate was my favorite. Tasted very close to the meal I ate in London. The staff could at least try to stay in character for the kids. It was just average all around.Tip: Split a butterbeer! Like a butterscotch version of rootbeer w/ a whipped cream topping. It was so sweet, that NONE of us finished ours. We could have gotten 2 between the 6 of us!
our group meet up here for breakfast. All the big hp fans in the group loved the look and atmosphere. The food was good everyone enjoyed it. Even the pumkin juice.
I've been here twice- once in July 2012 and the second time at the beginning of April 2016. The food is very well priced, great selection, phenomenal quality, very large portions, helpful staff and manager, and it has been fully packed each time I went. I highly recommend the fish and chips, chicken, ribs, corn on the cob, and the salads. Turkey leg was a little salty for us, but the manager was understanding and very helpful! Great place for our family and would highly recommend!
The is a cafeteria style restaurant designed to move people through fast however it is delightful! The atmosphere is breathtaking and fits the Potter area of the park. Service was well organized and friendly ensuring you had a table to sit at. The food was really very good. Perhaps the best theme park fare I have had. Roast chicken and roast potatoes is my recommendation. No wet nap wipes and no take away packages however. 5 of us ate for $52 with water for drinks. Not bad for universal!
We were so glad we looked up the review and headed here while we were at Universal! We didn't know what to expect but the whole Harry Potter area was amazing! The architecture was just amazing! It felt like you were in there and we really looked forward to eating here and try their butter beer and everything! We're so glad that we were able to get in. Yes, there was a long line but it moves so fast and we were worried about how much it would cost and if it was too expensive for the whole family but this was one of the best meals we had at the whole Universal. We loved the Feast! It was so much fun! The salad was delicious and fresh! The Roasted Chicken was really good and even the veggies was yummy n buttery. It was just large enough for a family of 7 but we also got couple of chicken strip meals for the kids too and that was really good. The fries were wedge fries that couple of my kids really loved. The fish and chips were delicious and I'm so glad we got that. It wouldn't have been enough if we didn't get the feast and we're just so glad we got the feast because it was delicious. The waitress came and brought it and actually dropped a whole corn and thigh but she came back and gave us seconds. So even though it was costly it was actually one of the better deals at the whole park so it is a must for you to visit. Don't let the lines scare you. It was really fast. We were worried that we wouldn't get seated but it was so efficient that waiters and waitresses were right there to seat you once you ordered your food. It's a little overwhelming to see what to order with the price selections and stuff but do your research and know what you want ahead of time, line up and then order it. I totally recommend coming here and eat in this part of the park. It is so magical and eating in there in the dark and in the benches just feel like you're part of the whole Harry Potter scene and it was just so much fun and a great way to be inside and not be so hot outside. Drink some butter beer in here because the line is way shorter in here than the Butterbeer line outside. Eat your food and just relax inside! Totally recommend it!
The fish and chips were great. There were a lot of people there to eat and they get you in, fed and out. The food was great, the service was great!
I am a Harry Potter fan, and I assumed that this restaurant was going to be a typical tourist trap. While yes it was mildly expensive (I cannot imagine having to pay the prices with young mouths to feed), it was not that terrible paying for a couple. We ate at 12, and only had to wait in line for about 10 minutes to order our food. Once I ordered the Fish and Chips it was not long until we got our food, and then were seated promptly. There were workers helping find empty clean tables, and we weren't left to stand there looking around. Incredibly helpful. The fish was AMAZING, and I got the lemonade which was very delicious (think hand-squeezed). I live in Wisconsin where fish fry's are a regular thing, and I would have to say that that Fish at The Three Broomsticks easily rivaled what I usually have. The decor and atmosphere was top notch, and I was incredibly happy with our experience. We were there during Spring Break and thankfully it didn't feel like Spring Break inside there, it was quaint -but busy, but totally worth the stop. If you chose to eat ONE meal at Universal, I would suggest it be at The Three Broomsticks!!
We had a late lunch here and found it to have the best food inside Universal. It takes about 30 minutes to get through the line, pay and get your food. The food is tasty and the atmosphere very Harry Potter. A nice stop to get out of the heat and relax!
Talk about a photo op here! Amazingly done! Food was a little pricey, but we expected that. Very good roasted chicken, fish and chips and bangers and mash. Gets very busy, but line moves quickly. Great experience! Glad we ate here! Butter beer!!!
It is a serving line type of set up, but was very pleased with the taste of the food. We had the American Breakfast.
Absolutely great food - loved the Bangers & Mash. Fish & Chips were loved by other in my party who ordered it. Others ordered the mini meat pies but I felt it was a skimpy meal. They liked it though.
Long line was intimidating but it moved fast. Inside the restaurant was really dark, but we sat out back bc my husband was in a motorized wheel chair. It was nice and quiet and overlooked the water. Nice scenic view. The food was amazing. Such a nice change from most quick service. I had the roasted chicken. Phenomenal. Highly recommend. If you have a large group get the feast. You will not regret it. 
Food drink and staff all lovely but this was a pricey venue with moderate portion sizes that didn't make us want to return for food
The breakfast was included as part of our vacation package during Mardi Gras week. We loved the all the breakfast combinations. My favorite was the traditional English which was perfect. Great atmosphere and nice and relaxing way to start the day,
We ate breakfast here. It was very good but remember its a theme park so it's pricey. No complaints at all!
We are here during our visit to Harry Potter In universal studios. Was wondering if food would be good and it was delicious. My daughter and I shared a meal and we were both full. Chicken was a little dry but still tasty. My husband said the fish was very good and the batter rated like dessert. We were able to get our cup of butter beer too which was exciting that we did not have to Stand in a long line to get just that. 
Visited Harry Potter area in islands of adventure and went to three broomsticks for lunch. It was a memorable experience for us as we ate the great feast for my family of 5. Was delicious, and enough for us as a hot meal. Also tried butter beer, but we liked butter beer ice cream better. 
We were only planning a drink here to get out of the sun for a while but the food sounded great - classic British fish & chips and the decor was exciting just like the film so we decided to have early lunch. It was lovely and fresh and service was fast. I like that they only serve HP type drinks too - no Coke!
line moved way faster than expected. Food is English Fare. The Butter Beer is GRREEAAT!! No expenses were spared in the design and décor of this Pub
Wee bit pricey. Get a lot of food for the money. Maintain the Hogsmead atmosphere. Buy specialty mug as you are leaving park so you do not have to carry it around all day. I save the Pumpkin Juice bottles. Healthiest fare you will ever encounter at a theme park.
The execution just really destroys the experience - you stand in a really long line, then line up fast-food style to order, then they bring the food on a plastic plate, the food itself was close to unedible. We were so excited but the ambience was zero and the food was terrible. Universal - please try harder to make this a more authentic experience for HP fans and not just another theme park fast food joint.
The best bang for your buck is the platter for 4. You get 4 delicious portions of chicken, 4 BBQ ribs, 4 corn on the cob, and a bunch of veggies!! My kids 7/12 and my wife and I loved it and for 50$ that's an amazing price for park food!!! F course you must try the butter beer!!
The Three Broomsticks is a must stop for Harry Potter fans. The food is good and they have an Ok selection. Fun place to see.
We ended up having lunch/dinner here after a long wait at kings cross station (there was a problem with the train and there was a 30min delay) we were expecting good food, at least better than any other place near byThe girl at the register was rude, it was our first time here and clearly she knew about it and was just rushing us to make a decision with our order. Asked her if they had kids menu and she just pointed at it with such a a bad attitude (kind of: duh) We ended up paying almost 70dlls for a turkey leg that by the way wasn't that good, fish and chips, chicken with potatoes and chicken strips from the kids menu. The place is nice, but I would recommend just going to take a look around
We are always impressed with our visits to Hogsmede. This was our second trip to Universal so we decided to have lunch at the Three Broomsticks. The lineup to get inside the restaurant was relatively short. Ho The lineup to get inside the restaurant was relatively short. However, when we got it, we had to wait in yet another longer line to get food.It is pricey to eat here. We ordered three kids meals, three ice cream, and two drinks in commemorative mugs which cost us just under $70. We had to wait to be seated at a table and waited so long that our ice cream started to soften. Despite the cost that was great experience.
The menu is limited, but the choices are varied. The Shepard's pie was mostly mashed potatoes. The pasties were good, but not enough to fill you up. You order in one line and pick up in another and then wait to be seated.
Shepherd's pie was not the best but better than some other park food. Turkey and ribs looked better. Good decor and decent ale. What you might expect for a theme park restaurant. Note: Line outside is misleading as it is a line to get to the inside line. Service and seating is good once you get to order.
The food here is much better than the rest of the park, We had the ribs and the chicken platter, and it was very tasty.
We enjoyed our lunch here much more than the previous day's at The Leaky Cauldron. My daughter & I shared the chicken platter which was plenty; my husband enjoyed his selection. The family platter was a nice option but more than our party needed for lunch. Cool atmosphere. 
Enjoyed lunch with a small group. Food was good, nicely decorated for Harry Potter, and the staff assisted with finding seating. Good experience!
Our love of everything Potter makes this a place that we had to dine at. It is very cool and there is plenty to take in while your there. That said, the food is overpriced and the quality is average. I am not upset that we ate there, we had to. It's just that if it was a normal restaurant, I probably wouldn't go back.
The food is fantastic. The immersion into the Wizarding World is phenomenal. I highly recommend the Great Feast for any family. It offers a ton of great food for around $50.00.
The atmosphere is great and little HP fans will surely want to dine here. We've eaten here for breakfast and lunch-both run as quick serve. Breakfast was super pricey for our family of five ($85). There were several choices including a plate with eggs, potatoes, bacon and sausage. Three of us got the pancake platter that was way overpriced. It was good. Lunch is somewhat themed and butter beer is available. 
At 11:30am on a Monday in February we had to wait 20 mins in line for lunch. The cost for 2 was around $30 (one plate each plus a drink).It had the best quality theme park food I think I have had. It was fine. We had the cornish pasties and like I said... it was fine. I had much better meals out at great restaurants in Orlando but its better than most of what else you'll find in the park. British Pub food.Enjoy! Get there early or wait a LOOOONG time!
Being a crazy Harry Potter fan i had to attend and eat at the three broom sticks and loved... My food was fantastic and looked like it could of been in the film. Definitely will attend again on next visit.
When you think of amusement park food, you think of paying Filet Mignon prices for cardboard. The Three Broomsticks casts a hex on this trend. I actually believe the Magical Feast is truly magically prepared. How else can I explain the great food at semi-reasonable prices?
Unlike most theme park restaurants, this wasnt overpriced. (the Turkey legs feed two!) and the beer is good too! stop in the Hogs Head for their exclusive brew
"On your way through Harry Potty's world, stop to enjoy Three Broomsticks. The interior decor is a sight to behold. We started our day with the American & British breakfasts. Delicious (try the ""blood pudding"" - which is actually a sausage tasting heavily of molasses) but prices not listed on the menu, except for the drinks. Seats at tables were just short of sitting on the ground!"
The main plus for this restaurant is the Harry Potter experience. The food was good, but the overall atmosphere is great. I'm pretty sure the frozen butterbeer is just liquid sugar, but it is so good!
This is our second visit here and it was just as great two years ago. The staff were friendly and in character. The food was good for theme park fast service. Yes yes it's expensive but you are at a theme park experiencing Harry Potter. But for the price you get a lot of food compared to other places on the island. Your here for the atmosphere! It won't disappoint. You really get the feeling that you are taking part in a meal as part of the Harry Potter world. The new Leaky Cauldron on the other island was a bit disappointing. Other than a big Cauldron it looks like your in a barn. Just our comparison. Check it out and make your own decision. Love the Three Broomsticks! 
This was a very fun experience. We love Harry Potter and breakfast at Three Broomsticks is very fun. The portions are quite large and they have a lot of options. 
We ate at the three broomsticks in Hogsmeade for lunch. We had more food than we could imagine. I would definitely eat there again.
This was part of the Hogwartz world. The food was pretty good. Really greasy. However the portions were large. One regular meal could feed two adults.
Nice Harry Potter atmosphere where you can get some English favorites and quaff a few Butterbeers. Some like the Butterbeer hot and some cold. There was not even much of a wait when we went on a week day. Pretty darn good for Orlando.
A magical Harry Potter experience! If you're a fan of Harry Potter you will love this as it is like it's supposed to be in the books or movies. The food itself is based on British cuisine (even though as a Brit it doesn't quite feel the same.) However, what I ate was delicious! The fish and chips was fab and they even allowed me to swap the fries for the spicy roast potatoes which was great. The other food looked delicious too and good portion sizes. Only downfall is that they don't do fizzy pop here, the only options were Butterbeer (which I personally dislike), Pumpkin Juice or the Lemonade (which isn't fizzy.)
My fiance and I had the fish and chips at this restaurant and it made us feel at home away from home. It was quite delicious and comparable to Fish and Chips from Newfoundland as many of our dishes are also British influenced. The fish was fresh and we enjoyed it a lot. I will definitely have to try it again when we go back. The downside to this place is that sometimes you have to wait to be seated. The food comes out fairly quickly so the wait if minimal. Just be aware that there may be groups waiting to sit when you go inside.
The food was pretty good, but could have been more food for the price. The décor was good as well. I would highly suggest eating outside and looking at Hogwarts while you eat.
For just the two of us, we shared the kids portion of fish and chips and a drink and that was enough for a light lunch. For as busy as it was, they moved us in pretty quickly. Somehow we got around the assigned seating and found a quite area outside the restaurant.
If you go earlier than most you can avoid the lines. The food is good, but pricey. The servers and cashiers are very helpful and do move everyone thru as quickly as possible. There is dining on the patio in the back if you don't want the main dining room. 
Stop in to Three Broomsticks for a little authentic Harry Potter experience and have some good food at the same time......go early!
"We visited The Three Broomsticks for lunch on our recent visit to Universal Florida. We are Harry Potter fans. It is worth visiting the building, but I would not recommend eating there. I had the Pasties which we near inedible. They were small and cold. Looked like they had been pulled out of a freezer bag and thrown in a microwave. It came with a ""salad"" which was a few pieces of iceberg lettuce and some tomato wedges. Probably about ¢15 worth of produce. My wife got the pea soup and same sad salad. Again, soup was almost inedible it tasted so bad. The kids got chicken fingers and chicken legs. They said that the legs were gross. I took their word for it. The chicken fingers looked like average chicken fingers and the kids are those. Overall it cost me $60 and the chicken fingers were the things that were palatable. Even the few grapes that came with the kids' meals were soft and rotten. I'm having a hard time understanding how this place has so many good reviews. "
With the exception of the Great Feast and a few other items, the menu is identical to Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley. Preferred Three Broomsticks over LC for quality all around. Frankly, we had much better service at TB compared to LC. From being assigned to a cashier, to getting our food, it only took 10 minutes (we went on a rainy day so that deterred crowds). LC was disorganized in comparison.There are only 4 sit-down service restaurants in the 2 Universal Parks. The buffeteria style of ordering, then sitting was efficient (assuming you and those in front of you have studied the faux food samples outside and a menu prior to ordering). I'm not a huge fast food fan, but there are times when you want to rest, eat, move along. With so much to explore, I appreciated the efficiency. Mythos might be steps away, but didn't seem worth eating there in the end. TB will most likely be my pick for eating a full meal in IOA.
Wonderful to sit down and have a great meal in the middle of your day. You can relax and eat in The Three Broomsticks in Islands of Adventure. I recommend the ribs they were excellent and my husband had the sheppards pie and said it was excellent as well. There was plenty of food and the atmosphere was great if you love Harry Potter. Even if you aren't a big fan the food is worth the trip to there.
Had to go here for the full Harry Potter experience! The Great Feast (only $49 and feeds (at least) 4 people!! We ordered the Great Feast or 4 of us and we had food left, it was awesome! Butter Beer is really really sweet! Worth every penny!
We were 5 people, splitting a Great feast platter.There was so much food, we were not able to eat it all, and we could have ordered a 4 people platter and still would not have been able to eat everything. This place serves authentic British food, ribs, corn, chicken and many more, like Shepherds pie etc. There was also possible to dine outside, the terrace was well shielded for the sun, and it had beautiful surroundings. 
Hard to believe that such a large and busy restaurant for visiting wizards may make a perfect plate each time, but that's the magic of Three Broomsticks in Hogsmeade Village. No muggle foods so don't ask for soda. And note, too, the absence of cardboard. It's a little secret behind scene's knowledge that JK Rowling has it stipulated within terms that no cardboard is allowed to step within the enchanted pub. And what this does is enhance the aesthetic flavor of perfect food. How many times have we been made ill from amusement park food? But not Three Broomsticks where chef's personal pride is signed on to each plate. My kid and I are vegetarian. The menu appeared to have no veggie options but by asking costumed server, was informed there is, and it's beyond delicious. Line's move quickly and food is plentiful, so a family of three can get by with perhaps two plates split up, and add on a couple salads. The veggie platter was only $18. With delicious clotted cream, a salad, and butter beer, the bill was under $40 still!
This was easily the best meal we had in the park... however, there really isn't much competition. My husband and I had the roasted chicken, potatoes, and corn. It was pretty good. My son had a turkey leg.... he said it was excellent. It is a nice diversion from the usual theme park hamburger and chicken fingers. However, it gets REALLY busy, so go at off times. The line does move fairly quickly, but be prepared for a wait. They also have a nice system where you can order ice cream, are given a ticket, and return to the counter to get the ice cream after the meal. The butterbeer ice cream is pretty good - not so much with butterbeer... it is very sweet. They only serve Harry Potter drinks - butterbeer, pumpkin juice, etc and water, so if you want something else you should bring it with you. It is a little expensive, but you are in a theme park. I would eat here again, but would not do it right at lunchtime.
The only meal I have ever gotten here was The Feast. This time around we had 6 in our party and The Feast is for 4 people, what I didnt know what that you can add to the Feast. So we were able to get it for a party of 6. Of course you had to sit and wait for them to bring your meal. They gave us to huge bowls of salad and then we got one tray with just 3 servings on the tray and everyone was going to freak out but they came out with a second tray with 3 more servings. Great meal as usual. And good to know you can add more to the Feast.
I loved Three Broomsticks. Although the line seemed long before we knew it we were seated with our dinners. Everyone was happy, but there was foods appropriate to the wizarding world which means so cheeseburgers - no coke. lol
The Three Broomsticks is the only place to sit down and eat at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. As a result, it is very crowded and busy. The sheer number of people would not have been significant to me had the food been good. However, the food was not all that great. We had fish and chips. The fried fish consisted of more fried batter than fish. In addition, the restaurant is set up as an assembly line, reminiscent of a large high school or college cafeteria - not very enticing environment when you are accustomed to table service.
It was wonderful feeling like I was actually in Hogsmeade for awhile. The team members were on point with telling us how to follow wizard rules in a restaurant and our food was surprisingly hot and delicious. We had the chicken and ribs, shepherds pie, fish and chips, and turkey leg platter and everyone was very happy. 
I was really excited to eat here but was unfortunately dissapointed. The atmosphere was awesome, just like the movie but the food was very expensive for what you get. I'd recommend going once during the trip but go during breakfast or something, don't come super hungry because you'll be disappointed. If you go, get the meal package. It's worth the money, but don't be fooled ! The butter beer is considered a SNACK not a drink! 
I agree with most of the other reviews of Three Broomsticks. That being said, it is a semi cafeteria type place. The restaurant is extremely efficient at moving and feeding an enormous amount of people at all times. We stopped in around 3pm and it still was busy. There is a line que outside as well as inside. You must wait in line to order your food then pick it up. They will then find you a table for the number of guests in your party. We noticed several international tourist were confused and walked it and sat at a table, only to be told to go back in line to order their food. The food was good for mass produced meals and had a hogs beer with was also good. Overall if you have kids or a huge Harry Potter fan, a stop here is recommended. For me, this is a one time visit to say we ate at the Three Broomsticks. Also, as to be expected with everything in the park, it was a bit expensive.
Dropped into The Three Broomsticks for lunch today while visiting Hogsmeade. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food based on previous theme park experience. I had ribs and my husband had ribs and chicken, both came with roasted potato slices and a corn cob. We both washed it down with a Hogsheads brew (beer). The setting was well done, with wooden rafters and stairs (inaccessible) heading every which way above us. All that was missing was a table of wizarding folk dining beside us!Big thumbs up for the entry/ordering process which made getting food and sat down a quick, efficient process. Double points to the cashier who seriously carded my 35 year old face!
The food was really good and they have a platter deal for 4 people which is a good value. Don't know if you can have your leftovers packed to go. Of course, butterbeer !!!!! Very well organized and great fish and chips!
Eating breakfast here felt like a once in a life time moment. The waiters are even decked out in a unique Harry Potter way (no spoilers!) and I felt like I was living in the books/movies!
Had lunch with a friend here for the first time recently. The theming is amazing obviously, especially if you are a Harry Potter fan.I don't care for the way they make you order all together and then get a table but it was busy on a slow February day so I can understand why they need to do that, especially for the busier times.Not realizing that you can't get Coke products here, I was a little perplexed as to what to order for a drink. Since I didn't want to spend over $5 on a Gillywater (seriously?) I ordered a sweet tea, which was pretty disgusting! Next time I will be sneaking in a Diet Coke!I ordered the Fish & Chips since I am picky and don't have an adventurous appetite. The food was good, nothing great. Obviously the main draw here is the atmosphere, not the actual food. I am sure I will be back again one day.
Just to say you had breakfast at The Three Broomsticks is pretty awesome. The food is average,but atmosphere makes this place amazing
"Theme park food is not known for being a great value. With that being said, the menu item called ""The Great Feast"" for four that is served at Three Broomsticks is a relatively great value. When our family of four went there (February 14, 2016), the feast was priced at $50. It consisted of 1 full rack of ribs, cut into 4 3-rib slabs, 2 whole roasted chickens, halved, 4 whole ears of corn, roasted herb potatoes, steamed veggies, and a huge garden salad: More food than our hungry appetites could finish! (Note: No drinks are included. We brought our own bottled drinks with us.)Our family was in and out in 35 minutes. We went to the cashier, ordered our feast, received our salad and dinnerware, and were handed a number to display at our table. We sat and served up our salad, and our great feast platter arrived within 5 minutes! (Someone brought it to our table. You don't get a ""server"", though. That was the last we saw of him.)The platter is arranged nicely. The roasted chicken was moist and delicious. The roasted potatoes were a hit. And honestly, the steamed veggies, corn, and salad were a treat after having eaten convenience foods! At a cost of $12.50 per person for a full meal at Universal Studios, the value is unbeatable!"
We are a family of 4 with 15 and 10 year old boys. The boys smelled the food and wanted to eat here. There was a line outside but it only took maybe 15-20 minutes tops to reach the counter inside and order. There is a Family Feast for $49 and pass holders or Amex card holders save additional 10%. It has baked chicken, ribs, roasted corn on cob, sliced potatoes, salad. My family wanted different things so here is what we ordered: one chicken and ribs combo, one adult fish and chips, one kids fish and chips, and one drink. We asked for several waters. It was about $38 with discount. First , I had the kids fish meal with two nice pieces of fish, grapes and some fries. The adult fish meal had 4 pieces or so. It was very big plate. My husband and younger son split the chicken and beef ribs meal. No refills on drinks except water. We really liked the meal. 
My wife, my kids, and I ate both a breakfast and a lunch at the Three Broomsticks and had an absolute blast. The food is reasonably priced for a park restaurant, the food is actually good for the price, and the setting's authenticity is remarkable. 
Food was okay, atmosphere was good. I enjoyed the scenery and the butterbeer. A bit pricey (42.00 for two people eating kids meal and butterbeer)
The food was good until I noticed a huge spider in my grapes! -_- I couldn't keep eating after that. The manager did apologize and they refunded our money, but I was starving and now unable to eat. 
Our holiday included breakfast here which we ate at on day #1 of our experience. We had the early hour access to the park so once we had made our way in and were in awe of how beautiful everything was we made our way over here. The doors opened about 8:45-9 we got in early and they usher you into a line and you go up to the counter to choose what you would like for breakfast. My family all chose probably one of each breakfast item on the menu, we all loved what we order. They have Canadian bacon, black pudding, tomatoes and mushrooms which are somewhat of an English selection. They only offer pumpkin juice at this location and The Leaky Caldrun. It was very tasty kind of an apple cyder taste to it. The room atmosphere is really authentic to that of the Harry Potter movies, all the workers are dressed in character. The room is nice and cool too!
No visit to the Wizarding world of Harry Potter can be complete without visiting The Three Broomsticks. The traditional English breakfast is great and filling. For theme park food, it's excellent.
This was a step into the world of Harry Potter. I would love to have some of that butter beer right now. Last year we had visited the Leaky Cauldron and this year we added The Three Broomsticks to the list. There are so many great places to visit in the Harry Potter World. The ribs and fish we really liked. The atmosphere can't be beat. I really think they did it right to transport us Muggles to the Wizarding World.
My wife and I both greatly enjoyed our breakfast at the Three Broomsticks! Ordering and seating were efficient. Food was hot, tasty and filling. Prepared us for a full day of fun at Islands of Adventure.
We had to eat at The Three Broomsticks in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, it was my daughter's grandest desire! The meal pricing was over and above what you would expect to pay for a theme park meal. When you walk out of the Harry Potter fantasy, you see exactly the difference I am referring. We had a traditional English meal for breakfast which was around $54 for 3 people. We then ate a late English Lunch and paid about the same, maybe a little more for $3 people. The food looked to have been prepared from frozen dinner entrees and tasted about the same caliber
We ate here to say we ate at The Three Broomsticks, but we had a great time and the food was very good. The setting of the place was awesome with the sounds, look and feel. It gets busy during lunch, but it's worth the wait! 
We only had breakfast here but it was very good. We had reservations as part of the Harry Potter celebration package we booked. I'd highly recommend this for breakfast. 
The Three Broomsticks was the only place in Harry Potter where you could sit down and have breakfast and other meals. They served hot butter beer which was welcome because the mornings during our visit was very cold. As with all amusement parks, the prices were high for what you get but, again, there were very few restaurant options right in harry potter section.
So good we came back and ate 3 times! We never waited and there was never a line but we tend to eat meals earlier than most. Great Feast feeds 5 easily - piled high veggies and yummy roasted potaoes, succulent chicken, incredible ribs, corn-on-the-corn and add some frozen bitterbeer for a quick, quiet break inside the A/C. Great, fast service and lots of friendly staff! They were quick to clean our spilled drink before we even got up to get help. Lots of seating and beautiful decorated like a movie set. (Service was so terrible at Leaky Cauldron and food cold & awful - come here instead!)
"This is Cafteria Style Grub, It was a cold Jan day and though it was a cool place to eat it was ""COLD"" inside. We had the fish and chips and shephards pie. The fish was rubbery and shephards pie was small and had herbs I never had in a shephards pie. It was a cold Jan day and the food got cold fast. If it wasn't because the kids wanted to eat a place like Harry Potter ate - we would have passed... Try Finnegan's instead - much better and served piping hot....for the same price"
The decor was very Harry Potter. We had the chicken and it was moist and reasonably priced for fast food. The service was quick and the restaurant was noticeably clean. 
We stopped in after seeing the menu and knew a good hot meal would be perfect for a cold day. The staff helped to keep the restaurant organized by seating customers and not letting people come in and save seats without having food. It ran very smoothly. The fish and chips were so good!! We also had the ribs platter and it was very tasty and the sides were delicious. The decor inside is spot on to the Harry Potter movies and really kept the theming going for the land. Highly recommend for a quick service meal in the park.
The apple pie with the crumbly top is so delicious! It is a perfect warm and sweet treat! The shepherd's pie is so delicious as well, I wish I had the recipe to make it at home! My husband got the turkey leg and it was huge! I loved the hot butterbeer as well! This restaurant is great and we will definitely eat here again!
We ate at The Three Broomsticks twice. The first time was for lunch, we had the chicken meals. Now I was not a fan of the chicken only because of the particular spices used. The others liked it. The chicken was moist and not dried out. The portion size was good. I always enjoy the potatoes they serve with the meal. I would recommend the frozen butterbeer. Great flavour but not as sweet as the regular. Our second meal was at dinner time and we purchased the great feast. It was excellent. It is chicken, ribs, vegetables, potatoes, corn on the cob and salad., This was a favourite for us. Everyone loved the food. The ribs were good. They were not overcooked, or greasy. The feast is supposed to feed four but it is so much food it could probably feed six. The service we received was great, from the cashier to server to the people who find you a seat. Everyone had a smile and was willing to help if you needed it. We were always given a choice to eat indoors or on the patio. We choose indoors as we love the atmosphere inside and just seeing all the details.It is a place that is must especially if you are a Harry Potter fan. I actually preferred this over the Leaky Cauldron this time. Our experience there was not what I expected and I have eaten there multiple times but that is another review.
We were excited to be at The Wizarding World of HP, and naturally (like any other fan) we wanted to 'live' the magic by eating at The Three Broomsticks ! The menu reflected good English 'pub grub'.. Fish & Chips, Cornish pastie, Shepherds Pie, Roast chicken and a Feast platter for a family to share. We ordered the Cornish pastie and Fish & Chips, expecting good hearty pub meals. What a disappointment !After waiting about 10 mins, we were finally handed one plate with 6 chips and 3 small pieces of fish (which was supposed to be cod, but unlike any cod we have ever tasted !)($US14), and a second plate with a few leaves of limp lettuce, a wedge of tomato, and 3 cocktail size pasties ( not Cornish pinched at top in traditional shape) ($US10). There was nothing tasty about either dish. Other diners around us were also complaining about food quality, price and slow service. I would suggest that they 'magic up' an English chef who knows how to make a decent Cornish pastie. Would not eat there again as there are far better options at City Walk or in other areas of the park ! 
"Like all things in Universal Orlando the prices are utterly ridiculous. I suppose it's to be expected - it's an amusement park. Staff was friendly and food was edible although it certainly won't leave you with a ""wow, that food was really good"" thought. Average is the best I can say and that might be a small stretch to go this far. Was not terrible for sure. Of course, if your a Harry Potter fan in your robe waving your splendid wand around, you'll probably think it's simply the bee's knees so disregard this review."
Traditional English fare for the wizarding fans. Pricey but that is to be expected in the park setting.
The food was good but it almost tastes like it was once frozen. Nice atmosphere, liked the details. The staff was really friendly though.
We were so excited to eat here in the Harry Potter section of Universal Studios. Unfortunately the meal did not meet our expectations. We had the pasties with salad (half of which was quite inedible) and seasoned wedges. The wedges were ok but the pasties were cold
We had a group of 10 people (5 children), and ordered the feast option. It included ribs, chicken, corn on the cob, and veggies and potatoes for everyone. Everything was very tasty! But it took a while for our order to come out. We think it's possible they couldn't find our table for a couple minutes, as we were seated outside. We waited at our table after ordering for at least 15-20 minutes. The servers were very busy and we didn't see much of them once we had our food. But the food and atmosphere were both very good! We especially enjoyed the cooked vegetables, ribs, and Butter Beer.
We left with full bellies and we are a family of four (2 adult, 2 teenage boys).After looking at the menu with all items around $12-$19 per person without drinks, we decided on the 'Feast Meal.' We choose complimentary water cups so the meal was $50. The meal was a big bowl of salad, chicken, red potatoes, corn, and ribs.Highly recommend to a family. Have a great trip.
Crowded but worth the wait. The dining options within the WWoHP are limited, so expect crowds. The food was really quite good especially since it's a theme park. I had the roast chicken and my friend had the Shepherds Pie. Both were good! Go out back and have a seat on the patio, with a view of Hogwarts castle. Best lunch with a view ever . Hogshead offers Dragons Scale and I found that quite tasty.
A lot of theme park food isn't the greatest. This isn't either, but it's decent. The fish and chips is the best meal. Definitely try the butterbeer (it's best frozen). It is connected to the Hogs Head, and their house brews, Dragons scale and Hogs head brew are good choices. It's awesome that their is real Fire whisky, too, and it is much better tasting than Fireball. If you are in Universal, this is definitely worth the stop.
Atmosphere is cool, but the food is just average here. I got the Shepherd's Pie, and it was like a tv dinner. Not appealing. The fish and chips, however, was pretty good, so would recommend that if you do go. We thought the Leaky Cauldron was slightly better than this. 
This is a nice place to eat that is quick and fun. You can get Butterbeer here and it is the best. We had the roasted chicken which was tasty. The fish and chips are wonderful if you aren't watching your diet.
We appreciated that the restaurant ordering/seating process was very well organized and you didn't need to stress about getting a table for your family. The food was above average for a theme park and the traditional English food options were fun. Especially enjoyed the butter beer.
The food is okay. Nothing special. The beverages could be larger, service was great, Setting great Variety limited but something for everyone Definitely a must do.
We had been so looking forward to dining at the Three Broomsticks, despite some of the reviews that complained about the mediocrity of the food. I knew it was going to be beautiful inside, but nonetheless, we didn't want to spend money on terrible food. Our group of 4 (2 adult, 2 children) ended up ordering the Great Feast, which is meant for 4 people. We were very impressed with this meal, and thought everything it included was tasty. The garden salad to start was quite good, and then the big tray of the feast was all done well too. The children loved the corn, and I personally thought the chicken had a great taste. There is an abundance of food with this, and for the price we thought we were getting a great deal. I would recommend this dish and would certainly get it again if I went back.
Located within Harry Potter's World, we had a delicious lunch. Three of us had the Fish and Chips. Three large pieces of batter dipped fish, with chips. You order and then pic up the food which was good because the food was served hot. The fourth person had the smoked chicken on a salad and said that was good as well. The only negative was that some of the chairs seemed intentionally low, which was uncomfortable for those unlucky visitors sitting on them.
The food is OK, the place is gorgeous, as it is everything else in Harry Potter's world here in Universal Orlando. I don't recommend the turkey leg, but everything else is good. Price is high, as expected in a place like this. Service is fast and, even though the place was full, very organized.
There is nothing really remarkable about the food at the Three Broomsticks but the atmosphere is terrific. There are a variety of food options and you are shown to a table by a server rather than trying to find one.Not a bad option if you are feeling hungry and you want to sit down and soak in the atmosphere.
First I am a Florida resident. I say that because unlike those people who might come to Orlando once a year or less. When the tourist season is here, most Florida residents avoid the tourist attractions. Those coming in for their first visit will be wowed by the scenery, The way the street is decorated, complete with snow and chimneys, is very nice. The butter beer carts outside etc etc. The Three Broomsticks is somewhere you should eat once to experience the ambience. As a Florida resident though, the high prices on the menu, and the limited selection, get tiring very quickly. I guess it isn't just this restaurant, but all restaurants at Universal. Paying 6 or 7$ for a couple bottles of water that you could buy st Sams club for 20 cents each! Don't know why theme parks have an exemption to the State's anti gouging law. I ordered an English tea. I wanted some real milk in a small cup to add to it as creamers just don't do it. I asked for a little more and you would have thought I had asked for a bar of gold the way they give it out by the ounce!I read reviews that the family of 4 breakfast is only $50 since individual entree are $15. That is no bargain for a couple of slices of potatoes, a croissant,couple strips of bacon, couple of skinny sausages etc. Then add drinks on top of that. You could eat at Capitol Grille for that much.Overall, kids thought the restaurant was ok. I thought the food was okay and over priced. But with no other options on site, you are stuck with it.
Went for breakfast as a treat. The décor was fabulous and so like in the movies. But that's were it ends. The breakfast which was supposed to be a English breakfast, tasted like the worst aeroplane food ive ever had. If I went back, it would be just to have a hot drink.
I did a lot of research on places to eat while at Universal Studios. Our main goal for Universal was the Harry Potter stuff. So of course when we saw that this place had Hagrid's Feast, we had to eat here! Its just a big meal for 4. We only had 2 adults and 1 kid but we decided that we would go for it anyways. The great feast was $50, but if we had bought 3 different meals for each of us, we would've spent the same amount of money anyways. We originally had planned on waiting until dinner to eat here, but we spent the whole morning in Diagon Alley and then did some rides in Hogsmeade, so it was late lunch by the time we ate. We were starving at this point so we figured we would be able to eat a good amount of the feast. This is a quick service restaurant. You get in line and then you order your food. You then get a receipt and have to go to another line to pick up your food. Then there is someone there to help your family find a seat. We didn't get the feast right away though, they bring that out to you about 10 minutes later. The meal came with a huge salad, 4 chicken leg quarters, 4-2 piece ribs, 4 corn on the cobs, and roasted veggies (broccoli and potatoes) Between the 3 of us we ended up eating all of corn on the cob, 3 of the chickens, 3 ribs and about half of the veggies. We were satisfied about the amount that we ate. This meal could've easily fed 4 adults, probably even stretch it to 6 people if some didn't eat as much. Overall it was a pretty good meal, a bit on the bland side, but worth it to say that you got to eat Hagrid's feast. Even though the line was pretty long, out the door, it probably only took us about 20 minutes to get our food. Hagrid's feast, a butterbeer and 3 waters came to about $60 altogether. The water cups were pretty small but they said you can go back to the counter and ask for more water. The feast is actually a pretty good value, considering park prices. Overall very satisfied with our meal here.
We had shepherds pie and fish and chips. Food was good and atmosphere was great. I asked for extra lemon and tartar sauce and it was on my plate. Loved Hogsmeade.
The selection is rather limited, and 'hearty' (high on carbs). Very little here thats safe for gluten allergies.
The food may not be what most of us are used to, but there are kid options and a dish or two that you will find at most restaurants. Most of us chose to live adventurously, and chose a different dish to share. We did enjoy trying the foods offered at the restaurant. 
This is a go to place in the park. It has very good English food and for the park it is at reasonable price (~$13- 17 per entree). The drinks are expensive at about 5-7 per drink though. However, the quality and quantity of the food was good. Service was also quick and courteous. We went for an early lunch at 11;15 and had almost no wait. Best was the decor, Harry Potter Ala English Middle Ages.
We had a late lunch / early dinner here and the food was fast, hot and good. The apple pie was fantastic, and very rich, we should have split it instead of trying to eat it all ourselves.
 Even if you want to experience Harry Potter completely I'd suggest you get some butter beer and eat elsewhere.We ordered Shepard's pie, leek and potato soup, salads, kids mac n cheese and chicken tenders and fries.The soup was simply inedible, the side salads a depressing bagged salad with a sorry tough tomato slice. Shepard 's pie was meh. The kids meals were tolerable.A sorry waste of $50. Wish we hadn't bothered.
The Three Broomsticks has an English style menu with things like fish and chips and meat pies. Everyone in our group enjoyed their food and it was ready within minutes of ordering. The pricing was pretty fair for being in a theme park. The restaurant itself is very fun to be in. 
We had breakfast here. The English breakfast is quite tasty and filling. The prices are very reasonable for what you get considering you are inside a theme park. Everyone in our group agreed that the Leaky Cauldron seemed slightly better, both the food and the layout of the restaurant. If we hadn't eaten at the Leaky Cauldron first then we probably would've thought the Three Broomsticks was great. 
I can’t say that the food was exceptional, but it wasn’t bad. I really liked that it wasn’t pizza or burgers. The real reason you go is to have the Harry Potter experience, and you will here. Get the quick service dining plan if you are eating mostly in the WWoHP. I just typed why at my website obsessiveprojects.com. Check it out under travel tips.
we had fish and chips, mac and cheese! and chocolate truffle for desert! we did not like the food at all! the worst were the chocolate truffle and mac and cheese! the fish and chips was much better! the place was very busy and I did not like the idea to wait for a table for a long time after you receive the food !
"This was the only place we found a rude employee. I won't go into details because I don't want her to lose her job but she shouldn't be in the front of the house. Absent that, the food (we had the ""great feast"") was the best food I have ever had in a theme park. It was fresh, hot and perfectly seasoned!. We had five in our family and we had food left. For $49 it was a great value!. Maggie, the supervisor, rectified the situation we had with the rude employee immediately, and was very kind. Maggie is a great asset to your company Universal!"
As a family of Harry Potter fans, eating at the Three Broomsticks at Universal was an amazing time.Compared with other restaurants at Universal, the food here was surprisingly good, and quite reasonably priced.The smoked rotisserie chicken was solid, as were the kids fish and chips meals. They also sold Harry Potter favorites like butter beer and pumpkin juice to wash down the food.The best thing about Three Broomsticks is the atmosphere and decoration. You really feel like you're in an ancient wizard inn, eating wizard cuisine.Very well done - and a must for fans.
Ate breakfast. Seemed very pricey until one of the girls asked if butterbeer was one of the included drink options. Pancake and American breakfasts were lots of food. Saved the croissant for snack later.
Fun atmosphere. Good fish and chips. Very crowded but the setup gets people in and out quickly. Right in the middle of Hogsmeads.
My husband brought me to Florid, specifically for Harry Potter world for my birthday. We stopped in The Three Broomsticks for lunch on our 1st day in the park. It was CROWDED but they seemed to know how to handle it. There was minimal wait time and the food was ready quickly. The atmosphere was great, it felt as if I fell into Harry's world. We had a great time. We will be back with the kids.
For theme park fare it is quite good but you really need to go for the atmosphere. would highly recommend
We thought this was the better of the two food options in HP world. Food was pretty good for the type of restaurant, service was good and the atmosphere fun.
I love having breakfast and lunch here. The lines move quickly and your food comes fast. I recommend going AFTER the rides. It feels like you stepped into the books. Love it. 
Avoid eating at normal times if you don't want to stand in line for 45 minutes to get a spot. Was expecting a bit more thematic elements in the restaurant itself, but there wasn't much there.
I enjoyed the selection and they are great at sitting people quickly and getting the food prepared. The Three Broomsticks has a slightly different selection of food compared to the Leaky Cauldron but both are worth trying.
Poor service. Customers are greeted by a host, who directs them to a line to wait to speak to a cashier, who takes the order and payment, and sends the customer to another line to wait for their food, and are then supposed to see a seating hostess for a table. In theory, not a bad idea. But it is not clearly told to the customers are often tourists who may be unfamiliar with the system. And our cashier was too busy talking to a co-worker about her personal life to effective take our order, and the expediter who served our food was very unfriendly and grumpy. By the time customers are actually able to eat, they have waited on 4 lines, and then get to eat an overpriced, skimpy-portioned, mediocre meal. Just go inside to get a butterbeer or pumpkin juice. Don't order any food.
We were fortunate to have breakfast at The Three Broomsticks.The setting is excellent.The food was really nice and the portions are big especially the fruit.My sister had the porridge breakfast and my mum and I had the continental breakfast.You get a drink included with the price of your meal.I had pumpkin juice which is nice.
Visited for breakfast. Food was terrible. Eggs, biscuits, bread, fruit. awful!. Go in to see the restaurant. They did a great job with the décor. Avoid the food!
We had 4 adults and ordered The Feast- plenty of food for all of us. This included chicken, roasted potatoes, corn on the cob, and ribs. 
We loved eating at The Three Broomsticks, it felt so real. As a family of 6 we ordered the Family Feast which was a ton of food that was delicious. 
In a sugar charged environment, it was good to see the menu at The Three Broomsticks had a balance of nutrition. The pasties were tasty and the shepherd's pie looked good. 
We came here to try our first butterbeer and it was good! The lines were really long, but that is what you would accept for a busy place like Universal! We sat outside in a sort of courtyard area which was empty, although the tables were very dirty… I would come back for another butterbeer when I return!
We had the best fish & chips at The Three Broomsticks! The service was very good and the staff was working hard to clean and turn the tables. Very good food. I also had the corn on the cob which was delicious! If you love Harry Potter then you need to have a meal in Hogsmeade. Worth it!
It is such a fun experience eating here! I felt like I was in the movies or the books. The fish and chips, roasted chicken and butter beer are so awesome. I will definitely eat here again!
The details are very amazing. The food is quite delicious; however, fairly pricey. I know this is an amusement park, portions good be better.
A must for all Harry Potter fans. This restaurant really facilitates the true Harry Potter experience.
While the majority of my party wanted to ride the Harry Potter Forbidden Journey ride, I stayed with those who did not want to ride it. We agreed to meet up at the Three Broomsticks. As we just ate, we got hot beverages while we waited for the rest of our party.You order and pay in one line. Then you are routed to another line to get your food and beverage, and then you venture onward for seating.In the order line, they would not take my order for just plain hot water. While I waited in the other line, they were able to fulfill my hot water order.It was a good place to people watch. You would see the wait staff carrying this large tray of food, which is part of the large feast order. A platter for four was $49.99.As the wait time for the ride was roughly 90 minutes, we ventured to meet up with our rest of the party after staying at Three Broomsticks for an hour. The place was hopping.
This is a good quick service restaurant that features Fish n' Chips, ribs, Shepherd's pie, Butterbear, Gilly Water, lemonade, Pumpkin Fizz. The food is good. The portions are large. The price is moderate to high. Seating is some what of an issue here. It's always full. There is usually a line. It's also very loud. 
The theme inside was worth the trip alone. We loved the bar set up and unique Harry Potter inspired beer flavors. We came here twice for the fish and chips with the children's portions being more than enough food (three pieces of fish, fries and some grapes). 
We went for lunch when we were visiting Universal Studios.We bought the Universal Quick dining plan so it was a good deal.We had the fish and chips, rib plate, butter beer and pumkin juice.The food was very good for a restaurant located inside a them park. the portions were huge and the drinks plenty.it was a good lunch break from a hectic day.
Decent quality food- had fish and chips (>$11.00 )and a baked potato ($2.75). Crowded but nothing special. Very limited opportunities to eat in this park.
"We ate here for Lunch and had the ""Feast."" It is billed as a meal for four, but there was more than enough food for five of us. It was served ""family style"" with salad, roasted potatoes, roasted vegetables, roasted corn on the cob, ribs, and chicken. Absolutely delicious! And at only $49.00 a very reasonable cost for feeding a family of five. The service was also very friendly and the ambiance of the restaurant was just as I would have imagined. Arrive early though, the queue gets long!"
"Really enjoyed this experience. Not your typical burger and fries theme park joint. British fare such as ""bangers and mash,"" shepherd's pie, etc. As you wait in line to get in you will pass a window with plastic versions of every plate, which is very helpful when they are using names not familiar to Americans. I enjoyed my food and especially the atmosphere which continued the magic of feeling like you were in Hogsmeade. The Hog's Head Pub is right next door and you can pass through from one to the other. A tip: Every time we have gone if the seating is full inside there are still seats outside in back. They are on a patio of sorts overlooking a stream, with a view of the castle, and most tables have canopies above them to keep it from getting too hot. There is ""magic"" going on inside such as shadows moving along the walls and such and no ""magic"" outside, but if you want a place to sit don't forget to look back there. Another tip is to eat off peak. We had lunch at 10:30 and had no wait in line. It got crazy later around noon! We just shifted out eating times and had no trouble."
Ok, better than Leaky Cauldron food wise, setting about the same. Chicken and ribs we shared were pretty moist, fish and chips were average. Butter beer and real beer, so worth a stop for sure.
No visit to the Wizarding World is complete without a visit to one of the themed restaurants. We chose the Three Broomsticks but were a little disappointed in the food quality - we tried the ribs, chicken and fish. The best part of the meal was the butterbeer and the pumpkin juice. The staff seemed rushed and impatient at a time when it really was not that busy - walked in without a wait. Theme and decoration is true to the Harry Potter books.
Food was great portions good, decore very cool, good service fun time, will return again and again !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The food was actually quite good. We had Shepherds Pie and Chicken Pasty, both of which were good. The butterbeer on tap (available throughout the park) is delicious.
"I started my ""all things Harry Potter"" day with breakfast at Three Broomsticks. It is a set menu with limited selections. I chose pancakes and they were delicious. They came with sausage that was quite tasty. The atmosphere really makes you feel like you are eating in an old English pub. (I have been in quite a few) My friends and I really enjoyed this restaurant. Don't let the long lines scare you. It moves quickly. I can't wait to try the lunch or dinner menus next."
We had breakfast here and enjoyed it. A tad pricey but what isn't in Universal....Staff was very nice and explained the dishes..You could have English or American type dishes. We decided to get one of the American and one of the English dishes (there are 7 different types) and enjoyed the food.
We had reservations but they didn't seem necessary as this is a huge place and there was plenty of room. The decor is amazing. There's a lot of attention to detail throughout the Harry Potter areas and this restaurant is no exception. Watch for the Dementor shadows that appear against a white screen way up near the rafters from time to time. Breakfast choices are Continental, American, or English, all very good.
"My husband had the chicken caesar salad - lot of big chunks of chicken! I had chicken and ribs. Both ""meals"" came to $27 which I thought was great for the amount of food we had. And it was good. I mean, really good, restaurant quality! The atmosphere of the restaurants are also very fun. I definately recomment either this one in Islands of Adventure or the Leaky Caludron in Universal."
The setting of all the Harry Potter areas is amazing and the eateries are definitely no exception. It is clear a lot of thought is put in to the surroundings and menu, and the food is very tasty but relatively overpriced for what it is. The seating area is quite chilly as well - definitely welcome initially on a hot day but after queuing for 30mins we were definitely shivering!
"If you're a potterhead, then this restaurant is a must-see. It feels like you're in the book, having a butterbeer with old friends. The food is great, considering this, afterall, an amusement park, and $30 dinner for two, while not ideal, isn't bad when keeping the ""amusement park"" thing in mind. We had the shepherd's pie, and Chicken/Rib plate. Both were great!"
We came to Universal specifically for Harry Potter, so we wouldn't miss eating here for the experience alone. Unfortunately, the food is not good. My wife's Cornish Pasties resembled something you'd find in the frozen food section. My chicken was bland. It seems people enjoy the breakfasts so maybe do that instead.
Took the kids for the full Harry Potter experience and they insisted that we eat here. We ordered the feast for four and it fed all six of us. There was so much food and it was absolutely delicious! I did, however, feel as if we were being rushed to finish our meal.
The food isn't cheap but not expensive. About $16.00 for breakfast but pretty damn good.Also, if I remember correctly, the hogshead is connected to the 3 broomsticks and it is a very nice place to duck in and have a late afternoon beer if you are sick of the rides. They have nice craft beers and the giant hog's head moves it head every few minutes.
"We live in Orlando and have annual passes, but never ate at The Three Broomsticks until recently. We waited until the dinner crowd was gone and took three small children and five adults to the restaurant. Of course, the ambiance was just amazing. And even though the food was pricey, it's no more pricey than eating anywhere else in IOA. I really, really enjoyed my fish and chips--they even had malt vinegar! My husband got his reliable turkey leg and our child had mac and cheese. She ate every bit of her meal as did we. If I have any complaint it is that you can't order ""muggle"" drinks here (which I totally understand) but they didn't have apple juice or milk for my little one when I asked. Thank goodness I had water with me so I didn't have to spend $4 on gilly water in the bottle. Don't wizards drink milk or apple juice, too?"
No, sorry. Magic it isn't. Ribs swimming in grease and cold slices of potato with fat over them didn't do it for me. Wife's chicken and ribs likewise got only half eaten. Stay away.
Kind of crowded when we were there but the food was excellent. The atmosphere couldn't have been improved upon in my opinion. The wait staff were friendly and helpful. It was a delight to get off our feet and have a really good meal there.
We ate here for lunch one day. The food was surprisingly good. Is it over priced -- Yes -- but most theme park food is. My husband and I both enjoyed our meals the kids did too. They like getting butter beer and felt like they were in the movie. Over all it was an enjoyable experience
"I mean, as a Harry Potter fan, who doesn't want to have lunch at the Three Broomsticks?! My husband and I indulged while at Universal Studios. We got the shepherd's pie and pasties. The shepherd's pie was very good, and pretty filling. The pasties weren't exactly what we were expecting (We're from Michigan, where pasties are large, like a ""hot pocket"" size. These were more like pierogi size). They were OK. The pumpkin juice was delicious. This restaurant is a well-oiled machine and I'm glad there was order to so many people. Overall, it was a fun experience and I'm glad we did it. "
We ate there for Thanksgiving dinner and got what they call the feast for four and it was more than enough for four people. I was shocked at how much food we got for the money. The serving staff were very nice and did their jobs well. It is a little dark inside so I suggest eating by a window like we did.
The food is overpriced, which is what you expect at a theme park restaurant, but it's so bland, that about the only thing good with our meal was the baked potato. The themeing inside is good, just wish they had hired cooks that had ever eaten actual food.
Just had to be done you can't go to diagon alley without eating here but be prepared it is quite expensive for a breakfast, but obviously you pay for the experience
OMG - This was the best park food we had during our time at the Disney/Universal parks. I was a little skeptical about eating here when we arrived because the line was so long. The line actually moved very quickly and we ordered within 10 minutes of arriving. My husband and I split the rib platter. It came with potatoes and corn. We also ordered a butter beer and pumpkin juice concoction to share. The food was so delicious and reasonably priced. I wish we had discovered it sooner. There is a sort of park meal deal that you can get here. I think it was $21 and you get your entrée, dessert, and a snack. You get a card that lets you pick up the snack at any Kiosk in the park. I wish we had discovered this place sooner. We were at Universal for 3 days and discovered this on our last day!
Best time to go here is 2 hrs before closing (they close at 7pm). No lines, food is fast, and the eerie ambience of an old tavern is really better at night than during daytime. I wouldn't have seen it any other way. Elves and owls are projected randomly in the 2nd floor so watch out for them. Don't expect much from the food. Butterbeer is the worst i've had. It's just too sweet. My order: Cornish Pasties. It was bland. Their fish and chips is cod, something i'm allergic to. Maybe order something else. The ambience and food is not as great as that of the Green Dragon at Hobbiton, New Zealand.
The Three Broomsticks was adorable. Good place for an afternoon coffee or a hot butterbeer pick me up! We ordered a couple side dishes and thought they were fairly reasonably priced, keeping in mind this IS a theme park!
This is my favorite restaurant in the park because they have done a good job of bringing The Three Broomsticks to life. It is counter service, but the dining area is very much like I imagined it when I read the books. I generally get the fish and chips, which are actually pretty tasty. 
We had a great time here, in a great setting. Food was inspired from England and they served interesting Harry Potter drinks. When I asked for a Soda they explained that Soda was not available in the Wizarding World which was thought was very authentic. The food was ok, not fine dining but enjoyable.
This place is as authentic as it gets. The decor, the music, and the outfits that the staff wears, everything seems like it came straight off the movies. Three Broomsticks doesn't serve the typical burgers and pizza, instead they serve rotisserie chicken, ribs, and fish and chips just to name a few. They also have a $50 platter that feeds at least 4 people. It's a combination of chicken, ribs, corn on the cob, potatoes, veggies, and salad. If you're traveling with a lot of people, it is definitely worth it. The food is good and the staff is helpful. Don't forget to grab a butterbeer to complete the Harry Potter experience!
We shared a fsh and chips and it was super. 3 planks of fried fish and chips (frech fries) with 2 butterbeers held us over until dinner. You order at the counter and they bring it to the table when it is ready. Atmoshere is perfect although busy with Muggles.
After a day full of magic, nothing could be better than a feast. Worthy of the great feasts of Hogwarts, the meals are surprisingly good for food made by muggles. Also, you get the chance to sit in an old, cozy little place and chug on Pumpkin Juice or Butterbeer. And if it's an exceptionally crowded day at the park, having your Butterbeer here rather than at the cart save you time so you can go on all the rides.
Not only do they serve great food but the surroundings are so realistic it made me home sick.The food choices are a refreshing change. Instead of burgers you can have a roast chicken dinner, fish and chips, shepherds pie, spare ribs and Cornish pasties.The Cornish pasties look disappointing as they are cocktail size but they are tasty. The roast chicken was huge and came with roast potatoes and corn on the cob.They are licensed so you can have a drink with your meal. I opted for the pumpkin juice and have to say it tasted delicious and I would return just for that.
Theme park food can be a risky bet. But the meal my family had at the Three Broomsticks was probably the best we had at the Universal theme parks. First of all, don't let the lines scare you. It moves pretty quick, and there are workers who will help you find a table. Seating is not a problem. There is a fairly extensive menu of British favorites to choose from. The decor in the restaurant adds to the charm. If you're visiting Universal for Harry Potter, this really is a must-visit location. Kids in particular will love it!
Healthy food and very filling. The meal was delicious. I would suggest slipping in for an early lunch or dinner to beat the crowds. If you eat between 11 and 11:30 you can beat the lunch rush. During meal hours, the restaurant fills up fast.
"I didn't have high expectations. Basically, in a theme park, you're pretty much a captive audience and I guess we didn't want to bother leaving the Harry Potter section of the park to look for better food. We wanted something light and quick around 5 PM to tide us over till we could get a late dinner at our hotel. They weren't very flexible with the menu and it certainly didn't have a lot of choices. But they did allow us to order two ""child sized"" fish and chips. Which was more than enough for what we wanted. The food actually tasted better than I expected. But it's probably not very healthy food. Just had to make our peace with it (convenience won out). The next day, my daughter and I shared a butterbeer bought at one of the stands, and later that evening I developed a very upset digestive system. I don't know if it was the butterbeer or something else, but that seems to be the most likely culprit."
We ate dinner here one night. We ordered the family platter which came with chicken, potatoes, corn on the cob and more! It was a lot of food and actually was a good value for the 4 of us. The best of all is it wasn't the normal theme park fare and the food fit the setting extremely well. We all enjoyed our time at the Three Broomsticks. 
We ate at the Three Broomsticks for lunch while visiting the Islands of Adventure. The food was good and there were a lot of options to choose from. We used the Universal Dining plan so it helped with the price. This restaurant had a larger selection than the Harry Potter restaurant in Universal.
The food here is always wonderful and never disappoints. Favorite restaurant in the park. I usually get the ribs and chicken. The corn is grilled with the outside peeled back but still attached so visually attractive and makes it easier to eat. GET BUTTERBEER or the Pear Cider!
We have eaten here several times and always go back when at IOA. We enjoy their fish and chips. The family feast is very good and a good value for a bigger group. Of course everything is better when accompanied by a frozen butter beer!There is a great attention to detail and to the theme.We like to go for an early lunch in order to avoid the crowds.
My family and I are frequent visitors to Universal, Orlando, and love to have breakfast and lunch at the Three Broomsticks. I've always thought that they served a nice amount of food for the price, and that the quality is quite good. The line moves quickly and service is great. The ambiance is exceptional. Whether you dine inside or outside on the patio, you'll have a lot to look at while you eat.My favorite lunch is the rotisserie chicken salad, while my kids enjoy the chicken and ribs platter. Be aware that you can get most of the regular breakfast menu items as children's menu itemsI highly recommend the Three Broomsticks!
We ate dinner at 3 broomsticks. It was a light crowd day at the park and a lot of seating was open inside. However getting through the line took awhile. Most of the food was mediocre at best. The ribs were dry and terrible. The shepherds pie was ok for a bowl of hamburger meat, cheese, and a bread topping. The drinks are a ripoff and all the other food is overpriced. I would get your token Butterbeer and find somewhere else to eat. We have been to WDW the last 3 years and Disney has it right with their food and the dining plan. We didn't get the dining plan here and a quick service for 4 is basically $55-60 eating on the cheap side. Universal should hire or consult the Disney chefs for their menus.

The Three Broomsticks is a must for Harry Potter fans, but the food is good so even if you're not a fan you'll enjoy it.We ate both a breakfast and a lunch here and enjoyed both.My husband got the English Breakfast, and I had the Pancake Breakfast. A little pricey for what you get, but the atmosphere is awesome.For the lunch we ate there, I had the Cornish Pasties and my husband had the Shepard's Pie. Our friends had the Ploughman's Platter which was a lot of food!We both enjoyed our meals. Everything was cooked well and very filling. My cornish pasties were a little dry, but still good. We found the portions to be just right, but they might be too small for those with a big appetite. For drinks I tried the Pumpkin Juice, the Hot Butter Beer (which was delicious!) and my husband just had coffee. The hot Butter Beer was as I said delicious, but I recommend trying the regular and frozen versions first. Each tastes very different and I will admit, once I tried it hot, the other versions just didn't taste as good. The pumpkin juice was good, although a little sweet.But let's me honest, the big reason to come here is the atmosphere. It can hold a lot of people so it can get quite loud. It's fun and you have the Hog's Head bar on the backside which is the only spot you can get the Hog's Head beer. Definitely take a few minutes and go out on the back patio area which is kind of tucked away and easily overlooked. Great views of Hogwarts castle, and if you're lucky, you might see turtles and ducks swimming in the water down below.
My daughter is serious harry potter fan so this was a must do for us when at universal. Food was better than i expected, my son and husband had ribs and corn on cob, we also had fish and salad and sheppards pie with side salad, everyone cleaned their plates. Happy to find food that wasnt all just deep fried in the park at good price. Be warned thought that butter beer is extremely sweet and neither of our kids could drink it, staff replaced the drinks at no extra cost which i thought was great. Atmosphere was pretty neat and staff friendly. Would recommend.
This place looks so cool, yet another area of the harry Potter section with oodles of unique photo opportunities.The menu consists of various traditional English dishes. I've tried the stew and the cottage pie and they're both gorgeous. The butterbeer and the unique cask ales are lovely too.Would definately reccomend this- it makes a great change to the primarily fried food on offer elsewhere in the Universal parks.
We visited the Three Broomsticks for lunch during our visit to Universal Islands of Adventure.Our family shared the Grand Feast, which had barbecue ribs, smoked chicken, roasted potatoes, mixed vegetables and corn on the cob. It said it would feed 4, so we also ordered the Mac and cheese kids meal. There was more than enough for all 5 of us, but my son enjoyed the Mac and cheese. The food we got was truly delicious! The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, the chicken moist and well seasoned. I loved the veggies, as well. Frozen butterbeer is so refreshing on a hot day, but the regular butterbeer is more flavorful. In terms of atmosphere, theming of the restaurant is excellent and the service was good. Highly recommend you stop in when visiting Hogsmeade. 
While the cool indoor theming is welcome, the food is just so-so. We opted, on day 2, to get a hot or frozen butterbeer from the Hog's Head to take advantage of the atmosphere inside. I can't remember anything specific about the food, so I guess I'd call it un-memorable.
We had breakfast here once which was pretty rubbish to be honest and relatively expensive but the interior is worth a visit 
The food was great even though what I ordered and paid for wasn't what I was given , it was still tasty. A single entree two sides and two teas, $30. Left full and satisfied. 
We had selected breakfast at The Three Broomsticks as an option when we purchased our vacation package through UO and you have to reserve your dining time in advance. This was a bonus for our family as it gave us an up and out the door time. Limited menu options served cafeteria style. Choice of English Breakfast, American Breakfast or Pancake Breakfast. Our party had at least one of each and all were good. The blood sausage included in the english breakfast was a huge conversational topic and most of us at least tried a bite. Nothing spectacular except for the scenery but nice, get your belly filled up, start the day kinda food. Expensive for our budget but the tickets were paid in advance with our package so no money out of pocket that day. Approx $15 per person.Hint: Get someone to find a table while some one else gets the food especially at peak times. 
For us it was all about being in the experience of Potter. We drank our beer (Red ale was Good!) and Butterbeer. Ate some tasty food. We liked the fried potatoes with our combo of ribs and chicken. A lot of food for the amount of money at Universal.
The way the food is ordered and delivered works really well in the very busy restaurant. The setting makes you feel like you are having lunch inside the entrance to Diagon alley.Well worth a visit
We visited on an unseasonably hot day so fish and chips, turkey legs, shepherds pie and other steaming hot meals for lunch weren't all that appealing but it was not bad. The frozen butter beer was awesome though. Service is so so, it's cafeteria style and the people directed you to a table once you get your food can be kind of militant but I realize they are dealing with some obnoxious people like the ones that butted in front of us in line and the dad literally tried to box me out to get in front of me like he was playing basketball. The place is well decorated and you do feel like you are in the book itself, which is the appeal so go and see it just don't expect a great meal with it.
We ate a late lunch at the Three Broomsticks, and I honestly was not expecting much. I assumed we'd pay extravagant prices for below average food, but I was pleasantly surprised. I had the fish & chips and my wife had a broiled chicken plate, both of which were quite good tasting and plentiful. Service was quick and pleasant. We enjoyed sitting outside near the 'moat'. 
Food was average but a lot cheaper than the hotels restaurants. The atmosphere was fun and entertaining.
Not only does this restaurant give you a great Harry Potter dining experience but they cater to all guests needs. We have travellers in our party that have extreme dietary issues and the staff was very accommodating preparing variances to their standard meals all with an exact list of ingredients. Very impressed with the service, quality, and the ability to go above and beyond.I would expect this type of service from specialized restaurants. I cannot say enough how pleased we were with our experience in a theme park restaurant. Definitely a must visit restaurant.
The Three Broomsticks offers classic pub fare as counter service. The food is a definite upgrade from the burger/pizza venues - with roast chicken, ribs, Cornish pasties, fish & chips, salads etc. The ambiance is straight out of the movies and they have silhouettes and sound effects that carry your imagination a bit farther. Definite must for HP fans and, for me, better than The Leaky Cauldron at Diagon Ally.
As is typical of any amusement park, the prices are steep, but they know you don't have a choice. A lunch for two, including an alcoholic beverage each, was just under $50. We purchased a fish and chips (think Long John Silvers and home fries), and a Shepherds pie. Both were okay, but the pie was probably a little more worth the cost. The restaurant can be busy, however, they have a great system in place to seat those who have just ordered and paid for their meals. The décor is very Hogwart's and the serving staff attentive. The park seems to be one of those rare places that has an abundance of happy staff who enjoy their positions. If you are touring Hogsmeade, the Three Broomsticks is a try-at-least-once kind of place.
"I really liked that when you're walking in, there are replicas of all the dishes in the front window, in case you aren't familiar with British food.Things that were delicious: The cottage pie and fish & chips are on point. It was nice to have a side of salad and not another plate of fries!Things to pass on: The chocolate dessert is just pudding, so skip that. Also, the gillywater bottle is pretty, but it's just $4 water. I should have just asked for tap water. Butterbeer is good if you like really sweet things (i.e. drinking frozen butterscotch) but it was a ""no"" for us. Note that you can't get regular sodas here--the server told us that JK Rowling didn't want them in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter to keep the ambiance in tact. Not an issue for us, but if you need a soda, get it on the way in.The theming here is the best of any park restaurant I've ever been to. Except for the water, prices were reasonable for what we got. I'd go back in a heartbeat! We went for an early lunch (11 a.m.) and it was getting full by the time we left."
i had breakfast here and spent more time looking around and enjoying the detail than i did eating. defintiely worth a visit.
We had breakfast here and I would've easily come back for breakfast each day we were in the park, were it not for my family wanting to try other places. Okay, there are no standouts on the menu (unless you count the obligatory butterbeer and can get past the so, so sweet taste), although the food is firmly in the 'just fine' category.But that atmosphere! I felt like I was on the movie set. Rustic, sunlight streaming through the windows, lots of true-to-the-story props and curiosities. I could've sat in there all day just soaking it up. (Disclaimer: we visited during a relatively slow time of year; I imagine that this place gets quite crowded, noisy, and altogether less 'atmospheric' at busier times)
Enjoyed eating here. I liked the Leaky Cauldron better, but the Cornish Pasties weren't too bad. It's worth the ambiance, if nothing else!
The food here was fantastic. You must try the pumpkin juice fizz. So delicious. All the food is fresh and very tasty. A must. The kiddies will love eating here
Food is average. Not meant for fussy eater. The entire process, from ordering to consuming your purchases, had a mechanical and production line atmosphere. You are directed to the counter to order your food. Once you have collected your food, you are directed to your seats. In the end of the day, you felt as if you were in Ford Motor's production line. 
The roasted red potatoes were fantastic. We enjoyed the family feast. Ribs and chicken were outstanding. Definitely feeds more than 4.
Very good food and service, and very realistic to the films! Every one of the staff were friendly and stayed in character each time we came to the three broomsticks.Would definitely recommend for good food and a great Harry Potter experience! 
"Roasted chicken, salad, fish and chips and butterbeer. (Just get one butterbeer and try it out; it's REALLY sweet, but good to share.) It's nice that they find a seat for you and your family ... although we initially walked by the person who was supposed to do that without her seeing us, leading to a little confusion and some annoyance at all the ""reserved"" tables.If your job is to help people find seats, you need to pay attention and not let us and several other families walk right past you."
A quick serve meal was 1/4 chicken and ribs with corn and fries. It was enough to share and came with delicious pumpkin juice.
Atmosphere and great fish and chips. That's all you really need to know. Even though I had the small, dainty meat pastries with salad, I tried the fish and chips and they were awesome! Oh yeah, try the Pumpkin Juice. Its pretty special. Have a great time stepping into Hogsmead.
Great for the Harry Potter fans to stop between the train and castle for lunch. I got the fish and chips while my husband enjoyed the chicken, ribs, corn and potatoes. Both were hot and fresh with large portions. He could barely finish his meal and he can eat! Really fun decor themed to Hogwarts pub. Well done and not too expensive for what you got.
This is old world food from the UK , with a variety of dishes that they offer from Fish and Chips to Cottage pie, Bangers and mash or my favorite Guinness pie dish !!
expensive (eating at Mythos restaurant was cheaper than this cafeteria style cafe). But you can't beat the atmosphere. HUGE must for harry potter fans.
Best Fish & Chips in a Park Restaurant Ever! Had some more in the Diagon alley restaurant and were not as good as these! 
Terrible service awful food overpriced absolute garbage,this is a fine example of how to get away with ripping off a captive audience.Best AVOIDED 
The WWoHP was the only reason we were at Universal and a visit to the Three Broomsticks for a meal was high on our list of 'must do'. Kids meals were standard, the soup and salad combo was great as were the pasties, and fish and chips. Theme was fantastic, was quite exciting for the kids to be in the Three Broomsticks! Beware frozen butterbeer is addictive!
Better food than anything we ran into at the Disney parks. Very accommodating and efficient. The staff went to great lengths to help or large group get through despite the fact that it is cafeteria style 
Ice cold inside unfortunately but that seems to be the norm for Orlando. So we were shivering when we ate a really tasty breakfast, great pancakes, lovely bacon and croissants. And ofcourse the Harry Potter atmosphere, cool! Will bring a hat, jacket and long trousers next time!
I had the traditional English breakfast, which was good, but it's hard to mess up breakfast, I think. The menu for breakfast is quite limited, but decent. Not sure if I'd go again. The Leaky Cauldron is better.
We stopped in during lunchtime and although there was a long line, it was constantly moving so our wait was only 10-15 minutes. The employees were all pleasant and helpful. Our food was delicious. The chicken and potatoes were amazing. I would recommend eating here.
Set up sort of like a fast food place, where you order at one window and pick up at another, yet the food quality is far beyond fast food. Prices were reasonable, considering you're a captive audience in a theme park. Lots of choice on the menu. They also had staff around the seating area who guided you to a table, so no one was wandering around looking for a place to sit. Very efficient and pleasant.
We had breakfast and it was excellent. It was hot, tasty and lots of it! You can have traditional English with grilled tomato (my favorite) or American or Continental. I had butter beer, it is very sweet, but had to try it, or you could have pumpkin juice, also very sweet, but how can you avoid those after reading all the Harry Potter books several times! It is good food whether you are Harry Potter fans or not. Enjoy!
It's tough to find food on vacation, let alone in theme parks, when you are vegetarian and can't have gluten or nuts. While not the healthiest of meals, I was able to stay plenty fed eating here. A couple of the salad dressings are suitable, and the baked potato was very good. We also had breakfast here once, (eggs and potatoes for me) but it wasn't quite as good as The Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley, or so say my kids who had the pancakes. Definitely worth eating here while you are visiting the WWoHP, and even if you don't have dietary restrictions it's much cheaper to order a few sides a la carte if you won't be hungry enough for their meals.
I came here with my parents in august and I must say it was outstanding Myself and my mother had the fish and chips and they were amazing It was as if they had flown them in from mumbles pier directly
This is a fun little stop that sells Butter Beer, Butter Beer Shakes and ice cream. It also sells some pastries and other drinks. But we went for the Butter Beer. It is delicious. We tried them all. The regular Butter Beer and the Butter Beer Shake was our favorite! It is a fun spot to take pictures, too.
We were greeted by a very friendly wizard who helped us look over the menu. They also have a display where you can see what the food looks like since you might not be familiar with some of the choices. The prices are very reasonable and the seating is well organized. The food was good. I had the pasties, a friend had the chicken, and another had soup and salad. The atmosphere is fun!
Located in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, The Three Broomsticks offers a Limited choice of quick dinning menu Items. Our party of 4 had the feast platter. Which is Load up with half rotisserie chicken,4 country style ribs,4 corn on the cobs and a large portions of steamed veggies and sliced red potatoes and onions.served with a large bowl of garden salad. After your initial order you join another line to receive part of your order then you join the host who is waiting for you and sends you off the a table. The whole process was fairly quick and friendly. I just have never been passed off so much before you actually getting to sit down to eat.The hot part of the meal is delivered to the table. The feast is presented family style..The atmosphere is fun and you feel like you are in an old pub in far away place.We really had fun and the food was good,messy & greasy but good!
In a 3 day visit to the Universal Studios Theme Parks, we ate either breakfast or lunch at The Three Broomsticks 3 times. The full English breakfast is as realistic as it can be with vegetarian beans, baked tomato, black pudding, English bacon, etc. The lunches of fish and chips or sheppard's pie were wonderful!! Food was served hot, flavorful, and plentiful! Highly recommended!!
Stopped here for lunch after discovering that food could be taken outside and eaten at the surprisingly quiet outdoor patio. This is a much more comfortable option for the solo traveler than the enforced dining room experience of its sister restaurant the Leaky Cauldron in the other park. My pasties were a bit greasy, but decent, and the side salad was nothing special but ANY vegetables are appreciated at a theme park. Staff was super friendly and helpful. The other food I saw coming out looked similarly decent -- nothing special, but in keeping with the theme and nothing looked terrible (which is high praise for quick service theme park dining!)
The decor and the ambience is great. Just like in the movie!! The meal portion were adequate and the staff was attentive and friendly. Unfortunately the food was under salt. Love the sweet corn!
Considering the logistical nightmare of trying to feed so many people at lunch time, they do pretty well. I think Universal Studios have done an excellent job in trying to give a feel and theme to every part including this restaurnt. No it's not fine dining but this is good mainly catering mainly for kids. The ribs and chicken were good 
Wanted to try this restaurant. It was ok but I prefer Leaky Cauldron in Universal Studios. $4.00 for a bottle of water seems a bit excessive.
"We had lunch here and enjoyed it. The food was good, and everything felt ""authentic"" to Harry Potter's world. It is very well organized to handle large volumes of people. The decor truly feels as if you have stepped into a restaurant in the books and movies."
The experience of eating here is nice and all but most of the food is average at best. Honestly would have rather just had a good burger option then their options. The chicken is o.k but the corn was pretty taste. The Sheppard's Pies left a lot to be desired. Again it's not bad food but not really good food either and more about the experience and atmosphere then taste.
My kids wanted to go here to eat while visiting Universal. The food was okay and overpriced for what you get. The only reason I would recommend going here is to say you visited this restaurant from Harry Potter. 
We ate here because being a Harry Potter fan it was a must. But I have to say that the food for the price was just meh. I got the salad and pasties plate and it was just some iceberg lettuce with three mini pasties that were not that good. Others in my party got basics off the breakfast menu and they too said it was just okay. I would suggest stopping in and sit and take in the experience with just a butter beer. 
Best counter service location at Universal, maybe in all of Orlando. Absolutely delicious, freshly made food. Enjoyed every last bite, and the price is not outrageous for theme park food.
Bit pricey but good. BBQ was very good and you get a good amount of food. Love the decor inside. Clean restaurant.
4 of us had the group dinner feast, which came out to about $12.50 per person, & it really was enough for all, plus delicious! Chicken, BBQ ribs, mixed veggies & ears of corn for everyone! Friendly service from the staff, & looked/felt just like the Three Broomsticks in the movies!
We went here for lunch and it was very efficient. The fish and chips were awesome and our son liked his chicken as well! But I have to mention an employee working at the door the next day - I got dizzy after riding the Dragon Challenge 4 times in a row on express pass with no down time (I was being stupid) and sat there at the corner of Honeydukes and 3 Broomsticks while kids shopped at Honeydukes. She ran over to me with a bottle of water and made sure I was ok. That goes above and beyond what her job is. Sorry I didn't get her name (did I mention I was being stupid that day?). Anyway, it's woolen like her make these places special. A big thank you to her and anyone who goes a mile beyond job description. 
You walk in and order @ the cash register. You go over to the corresponding # to pick up your food. I am gluten free so they made sure to not contaminate my food. I got the roasted chicken with corn on the cob and roasted potato. Delicious. I would go back if we return. It was nice to come in and sit down for a meal. My hubby got the fish and chips. It was very tasty he said. We did get the stein of butterbeer here with .99 cent refills through out the park. Not on butterbeeer but soft drinks. If you get it refilled 3 times you've gotten your money's worth. Total bill for 3 with the stein was $63.Take your time to walk around the restaurant and look around. Very cool décor.
As it was our honeymoon we decided to treat ourselves to a meal in a harry potter restaurant We went for breakfast and at 15.99 for breakfast with a small drink was a little on the pricey side. We were very happy we went and the atmosphere inside was really good. Wouldn't go back but glad we went. 
The food is pretty good considering they are cooking for a ton of people. The attention to detail is what you really go for though. It plunges you right into Harry's world and it's amazing!
There are a variety of British style foods. Most are quite good and my husband who is a Brit says they taste like home. The fish & chips were outstanding! Lines move quickly even at the busiest times. Try a butterbeer!
The menu seemed a bit more limited than the Leaky Cauldron, but the fish and chips we ordered was crispy, golden brown goodness. And, of course, we had to have butter beer again, frozen this time. The Leaky Cauldron is my preference, but no reason not to go to both.
a must when visiting harry potter in univers studio's. food is not so great but you're there for the experience anyway. went here for both breakfast and lunch... i would rate the food 3/5. frozen butterbeer is great! :)
Definitely felt like you were in a Harry Potter novel. The breakfast was good. I just wish they had a better system of ordering/seating. Sometimes you could seat yourself but other times you had to wait for a staff member to find you a seat. And sometimes that staff member was no where to be found.
"Fish and Chips are my favorite, but any food here is always presented in the spirit of the where you are, Hogsmeade Village. It's not just about the food, but the whole idea that you are in this magical place that you can catch a glimpse on a wall of a house elf scurrying about upstairs and hushed voices discussing ""you know who"". Eat, watch, & listen; you may be surprised by what you see and hear."
We enjoyed the feast option for four or more guests...don't forget the butter Beer! Good value and a fairly healthy option!
The food is good but not fabulous. You would like to try the Butter Beer (its not Beer :) ) and the theme is very well displayed all over the place. Recommended!
This has most everything you would want if you were to immerse yourself into the Harry Potter world. The food was excellent and of course, you can order yourself up a butterbeer or pumpkin juice. Wonderful!
We booked the universal hotel package and got to eat here with that included. It was so fun, service was good, everyone was nice and the breakfast was big! Get your butter beer with your meal too! :)
Great atmosphere, reasonable food. Good for a break during the day - we did late breakfast. There was a good choice but the fruit was a bit tasteless on all the plates. The food was not really what we went for - the experience was great.
We ate here I think 3 times during our last trip its one of our favorites in universal it makes you feel like your right there in the movie. My son is a huge harry potter fan! The food was pretty good too we had the fish and chips and breakfast one day. Tried the shepards pie but wasnt a fan.
My friends and I recently visited Universal to check out the new Wizarding World of HP. The three broomsticks delivers a satisfying lunch, steeped in an authentic atmosphere that transports you to the heart of Hogsmeade. The food was hot, fresh, quick, and plentiful; for the price, it was certainly fair! We purchased the universal dining plan, which covered this meal and so much more! Definitely recommend! 
Breakfast & Lunch delicious here! Not many choices for a real breakfast. So glad this place had it and it was delish!
Good hearty English style food. A great relief from burgers & pizza. The beers on tap were good as well.But the best thing is the feeling of stepping into the movies. Incredible, complete and consistent theming
The food here is above average and interesting, but the ordering process is a bit frustrating, and while they show you to your seat I was left trying to juggle trays of food and beverage myself.
The Three Broomsticks restaurant in Hogsmede at WWoHP was a highlight of my trip to Universal. The food was fantastic, the atmosphere was authentic and very true to the movies. The menu had vegetarian friendly options as well. We booked it for breakfast and went back again. Don't miss it! 
Atmosphere is great, food is expensive but the main attraction is the Butterbeer which you can buy hot, frozen or normal. Hot tasted like melted butterscotch and frozen was amazing!
Both my daughter and I thought that this was the best meal we had at the park - we got in right away, the food was hot and well-seasoned, and the atmosphere was amazing. I had the roasted chicken platter, my daughter had the mac and cheese. Both were excellent, a far cry from typical park food. 
We enjoyed the Three Broomsticks a great deal on our recent visit. It seems as if you are in the movie--if you are willing to believe! Our party of 5, four adults and a 4-year old, shared the Great Feast and it was plenty of food, even as hungry as we were from our early arrival and hiking about the park. Roast chicken, ribs, corn on the cob, and roast potatoes that arrive on one huge platter for the table were all very good, especially for park food. We arrived right at 11 and they were already serving lunch with no line. You order at one of the many registers and pay, then pick up your drinks at another counter. Usually you are directed to a table, but since it wasn't crowded we had to find our own. They switched to directed seating soon after we got settled. Our meal came in about 10 minutes and they also brought plates, utensils and napkins. Altogether it was a welcome respite from the crowds with a satisfying meal and quick service.
"Great food considering its ""park food"" We had breakfast and it was a typical ""English"" breakfast. Its pretty pricey if you are not on the dining plan. "
Dropped in for a butterbeer whilst visiting hogsmeade - quaint little place truly representative of the real three broomsticks in Harry Potter! Definitely a must if visiting also 
Great theming. , had shepherds pie and salad served really quickly , the waitresses seat you and you can't sit unless you have collected your food already so no sneaking in and keeping seats , we were seated straight away , shepherds pie was really nice quite a large portion compared to other places in universal very reasonably priced no more expensive then any other quick service dinning restaurant , great atmosphere and theming .
Harry Potter themed pub at Islands of Adventure, Universal. It is definitely worth visiting to see something featured in the films.
My daughter reserved this place for our family as she had read about it. I thought they were going to have characters or some kind of show in it because of the Harry Potter theme, but that wasn't the case.The breakfast theme foods were variable and the grandkids all enjoyed their pancakes. My son-in-law got the English breakfast and like it. My daughter and I had the American breakfast. The food was good though overpriced, which seems to be the trend in all the theme parks.The building was Harry Potter themed and interesting.
We HAD to stop here. I either wanted to come here or the Hog's head, and we chose the Three Broomsticks. We had fish and chips, and tried two different kinds of Butterbeer. The food was good, the atmosphere was awesome, the butterbeer was sweeeeeeeet, but I'm glad to say I've tried it. I liked that it was a quick service place, but there was a hostess who told you where to sit, and you didn't have to fight with anyone to sit at a dirty table... bussers were doing the rounds cleaning. It was an excellent place to stop over for some traditional English Pub-type food. Will be back!
We had breakfast here one morning. The food was good, but the ordering situation was very confusing. This is self seating which can be a problem when it gets busy, but the atmosphere inside was exactly as it had been described in the books.
3rd visit to this restaurant.Delicious food and drink.Ambiance of the place is fantastic.Good value for money.
This is our second time to eat here. We ate here towards closing time so there were very few people. Butterbeer here is a must! Everyone enjoyed their food very much except me. They got the rotisserie chicken and ribs. I got the shepherds pie which had really tasty mashed potatoes on top, but I just did not like the gamey flavor of the meat/veggie mixture on the bottom. Maybe it was the lamb. We also did not care for the potatoes (looked to be red) that came on the side. I would love to eat here again but not get the shepherds pie. The theming was great as usual, and be sure to look up for house elves shadows above you.
Recommend the fish and chips. Of course, you have to have Butterbeer. I had the Sheppard's pie with salad, which was decent. Surprisingly large portions. Service was quick, ample seating with a fun atmosphere. Lovely change from typical theme park restaurants/food, with lots of details in the building.
We always eat breakfast and lunch at the Three Broomsticks sometime during our trip. I love how both the Harry Potter world restaurants have English fare and how it's usually a pretty good value. We often share meals as it's too much food for one person. The fish and chips are delicious and we love the breakfast potatoes!
We waited until the crowds had finished and had lunch at about 4PM. Nice. No big lines. But no service! I didn't expect this to be a fast-food joint in which you carry your own tray to the table.We asked for the four-people meal. It was all right, in fact a little better than your usual park food. Not expensive- agin, for park food.Then one of us had to use the restrooms. And lo and behold, there isn't one. You have to go outsidem to the most crowded public bathroom in the whole park. Not good, Broomsticks, not good.
If you don't want typical theme park food this is a solid choice. Expect a line at most times of the day because this is part attraction as well as a restaurant. Like the rest of the Harry Potter world you can spend some time just looking up at the detail that went into the building. The dining room is very large and seats a lot of people. They organize the line fairly well, when you get to the front there is someone who will direct you to the next available cashier. They will take your order and give you your drinks and a number. You'll stop by the condiment station then at the entrance to the dining room a hostess will ask how many are in your party. On a busy day there are dining room attendants all over the place signaling to each other to communicate how many people need a table and who has one available in their section. It really didn't take long for just 2 people but larger groups may have to wait a bit. Our food was delivered not long after we sat down. I had the pasties and my daughter had a salad. Both were fresh and we were both happy with our meals. I liked the pasties but now that I have tried them will try the Shepard's pie next time. No need to clear the table, they have bussers that will swoop in as soon as you stand up. Take some time over your meal to just look around, I have said that in all my reviews for Wizarding World because it's just fantastic and as close as you can get without being on set. 
I liked the atmosphere, but was hoping for the servers to serve us our meal. We had to wait in line and then order it at the counter. We had chicken sandwiches and fries that were good. You can get butterbeer here along with regular beer and soft drinks. 
For Potterheads, this is a great place to eat. Usually busy, but the staff will help seat you. Service is pretty fast; food quality is great. Serving sizes are pretty large; we didn't finish all of our food. Have the butterbeer!!
We booked in advance but please do not waste your time or money! Breakfast was awful, the atmosphere was lame as it did not represent the actual dining hall 
"great lunch options! was even able to get a picky ""chicken only"" eater to try the ""fish and chips"" because it's what ron, hary and hermoine would have eaten! the building is amazing from tip to ""tale""!!"
If you go with family, order the family plate! It is a little pricey, but then again, what isn't in Universal?! You definitely get the most bang for your buck, talk about a lot of food!! Sodas are not on the menu, but the lemonade is amazing!
Delicious food and atmosphere served up in this establishment at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Food is about average in price but excellent quality. Would go back for seconds, and in fact we did the next day!
This was a really neat restaurant. Really felt like I was in a Harry Potter movie. Could actually find some healthy food. Best part of this restaurant for us was having he staff find us a table instead of having to fend for one ourselves like we do at Disney restaurants.
Since our son is on a strict dairy free & gluten free diet, we know he can safely eat at The Three Broomsticks. Since our kids are older now, the kids meals aren't enough. Last time, we ordered the feast. It was plenty of food for the four of us. We can't wait until our next trip!!
"Very good food, the cornish pasties are really good, but the visual effect is stunning, kid's that were in here during our visit were super excited, the atmosphere was electric with kid's thinking they were in the ""real one from the movies, really a must obn a gisit to universal "
Very detailed reproduction of the movie set. It was impressive how efficiently they moved customers through the lines and the food was very good. 
The food here was great. served fast and hot. not your run of the mill burger & fries. real people food. When you go to Islands of adventure you MUST go to this place to eat
We had the Universal Studios meal vouchers and decided to eat lunch here one day. I had the chicken and rib platter with the corn cob and potatoes. I was surprised how good it was for Quick Service in a theme park. I got the pumpkin juice as well. I loved it. Had a second one later.
Looking to recharge and escape the hubbub and heat at the WWHP, we ducked in Three Broomsticks for lunch. I was pleasantly surprised at how organized they were in serving and seating customers and in the overall quality of the food. We had the smoke chicken and turkey leg dinners and they were quite good, as park food goes. Daughter also loved the thematic setting for dining. A good choice. 
We found the food here to be average at best. While the menu had some interesting thematic selections, the quality was average at best. My daughter enjoyed the fish and chips, but my Bangers and Mash were kind of just....yuck. We were one of the last families served that evening so I kind of understand, but still...The service was okay. The servers stayed in character but obviously were at the end of a long day and it reflected.
I was expecting your typical theme park food here but was very wrong. The line was long but definitely worth the wait and it was very organized and moved quickly. We ordered the family feast for the 3 of us, which was alot of food but cheaper than all ordering a platter. I have to say the chicken, ribs potatoes and corn were excellent. It was all very fresh and hot. I would most definitely go back to eat here again.
All self serve and if busy a real cattle call. Fish and chips very good, meat pasties and salad just average. Rather surly seaters/buspersons, but they have a lousy job. 
My wife and I recently visited the The Three Broomsticks during our honeymoon in Orlando, as a HUGE Harry Potter fan I was really looking forward to eating in one of the themed restaurants and after travelling on the Hogwarts express we ended up in Hogsmeade at The Three Broomsticks.I hate to be so negative about something I'm so passionate about so want to balance this review with something positive, the pub itself is fantastically themed as it exactly what it should look like, I felt completely emerged in the wizarding world. Unfortunately the food really wasn't good and the service was very slow, I had fish and chips which was quite tasteless and very oily, and my wife had Cornish pasties and salad, she described the salad as very plastic and the Cornish pasties as very over seasoned with herbs and tomatoes, tasting nothing like a Cornish pasty.Both Universal and Islands have plenty of amazing places to eat, unfortunately this is not one of them and we would not recommend.
You will stand in line to order your meal and wait in another line to pick it up. After picking up your condiments,you'll wait to be seated. Surprisingly this happens pretty quickly. Eating a little off schedule will help reduce the lines. If you plan to eat the most expensive meal, order the meal plan. Eat inside to see interesting shadows on the walls. The chicken and ribs is delicious and filling. I live the lemonade tea. The pumpkin drink seems like a good idea at the time but is a little over powering. During off times, this is a great place to order a frozen butter beer and relax. 
"We ate here twice, opting for the chicken/rib combo once and fish & chips the second time. Portion size is decent, food is good, and it's definitely a fun place to eat. My wife really liked the Butter-Beer, I liked the ""full-test"" Hogshead Brew (lager)."
really fun place loved the atmosphere. we only had desserts and butter beers, both were good prices are what you would expect at a theme park.
Nice setting. Food mostly OK and priced better than Disney. The corn on the cob came out COLD and instead of correcting it, they handed over another cold one. Then, after everyone else had finished their meal, they gave us two hot items instead of a refund.
We loved the English pub-style food here and the atmosphere is second to none. Such a fun place to have lunch or dinner. We did not have breakfast, but I'm sure it would be great too. The food we had was very tasty and such a welcome difference from the typical theme park fare (burgers, hot dogs, etc.). The portions may be a bit small if you are really hungry. But the prices are great so just grab an appetizer, side item, or share another entree if you are especially hungry. We also love that there are fresh salads and yummy veggies with the dishes. We loved it! 
The number one plus here is the ATMOSPHERE! If you have read the Harry Potter books or watched the movies, you will feel like you are literally stepping into the pages or leaping onto the screen. They have captured the spirit of Harry Potter's world to a tee, and being in this restaurant was truly a delight. I felt like I was a Hogwarts student on a Saturday trip to Hogsmeade. The food is absolutely delicious, especially if you love British fare, and the waitstaff were as friendly as any you would see over at the Disney Parks. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves good food or Harry Potter! And remember: you're paying to step into Harry's world, so be a good muggle and open that wallet!
Harry Potter fans will love the look of the place and the atmosphereThey of course have butter beer whis is a must haveI had the mini pies which are vegetable potatoes and beef...not great but my family had the fish and chips and loved it
We waited in line about 30 minutes to eat lunch here. The staff was extremely organized with 6+ cashiers and corresponding pick up counters for your food, while another staff waits to seat you. The restaurant is very nicely decorated and themed. We ate the shephards pie and chicken plate and don't forget the frozen butter beer. Worth the wait!!
A good place for Harry Potter fans to get a somewhat healthy meal. The service was quick and friendly and there was excellent air conditioning for a hot summer day. As far as park food goes, Better than average but pricey, of course.
Fun themed atmosphere for Harry Potter fans of all ages! The food was quite good and not as overpriced as one may expect from a theme park. For a party of 2, we spent about $37, drinks included, and left feeling satisfied not overly greasy. The meal kept us fueled for most of the rest of the day. The shepherd's pie was filling and tasty. The roasted chicken, potatoes, and corn on the cob were delicious as well. The chicken was substantial. We tried one regular Butterbeer and one frozen and they were both amazing! Definitely must try both! We stopped in for lunch and there was a long line but it was efficient and went quickly.Definitely give it a whirl!
So everyone knows that meals and food in he parks cost a ton of money. BUT when we went to the Three Broomsticks they had a deal for a platter of food for four people for $49. We had five people and so I added an extra serving. OMG so wasn't necessary. There was so much food! They didn't scrimp on the servings at all. There was chicken breasts, a serving of ribs, salad, bread and vegetables for everyone and with lots of leftovers. It was so great. I highly suggest that of your looking for a place to dine with your family while at Universal Studios/Islands of Adventure, you check out the Three Broomsticks. Also as a side note the butterbeer is an absolute must! Out of the four options (hot, regular, frozen, or ice cream) we 10000000% all loved the hot, followed by the frozen, then the regular. We didn't get to try the ice cream, but I hear it's amazing. 
Had to wait in a bit of a line but you can make reservations. We had fish and chips dinner. It was really good. We highly recommend it.
Great themed eating place. If you want to eat or drink while in H.P go here food great a little pricy but hey your doing the full h.p.
Despite being virtually empty it took us ten minutes to be 'admitted' once in we opted for the full English breakfast....oh dear.Rubber scrambled eggs, rock hard black pudding, strange tasting 'English' bacon, chipollata sausage , half a tomatoe covered in bread crumbs decent beans and a croissant of all things!If you're looking for prison style eating this is your place, dreadful.
Had the American Breakfast. The food was very good; even the coffee. Service was fast and waited less than 10 minutes for food to come to the table. The price was high I think for a breakfast. Over $15. Maybe I am just getting old. If you have a family of 4 or 5 it is $100 just for breakfast.
Overall we enjoyed our visit to this restaurant. It was fairly pricy for a family of 4; nearly $60 including drinks. But in context this was OK because we were routinely paying $50 for terrible food (burgers) in the other places in the theme park. Here, the service was efficient, and there was an interesting environment. The other thing to bear in mind was that this was for a fairly substantial sit down lunch (at least for me) in nice air conditioned and reasonably quiet location. Coming from the UK we were a bit apprehensive about having British grub. But in the main the dishes were decent; no complaints about the rotisserie chicken (with giant corn on the cob) or fish and chips. As others have noted, the pasties were a bit on the titchy side, and the same was true for the shepherds pie portion. There was a good selection of interesting drinks to try. The butterbeer has received mixed reviews but we all liked it. One of the downsides of this restaurant and the Leaky Cauldron on the other Universal site, is that there are no toilets inside the restaurant. So you need to venture outside (into the heat), which is a bit of a nuisance if all you want to do is wash your hands.
My family went for breakfast. There was a selectiion of the usual breakfast fare. Breakfast is kind of expensive. The vouchers you get from your vacation package will not cover you entire meal so be prepared to pay some money out of pocket. The whole reason to go to this restaurant is for the experience. If you love the movies you just have to go there.
We had breakfast and dinner here during our trip. The atmosphere is cool for a Potter Head like my daughter. The food is just okay, a bit blah and bland. For breakfast the fruit and oatmeal was very good, disappointed it comes with a buttery fatty croissant. They would not substitute it for something else for people that eat healthier. For dinner the chicken and salad was so blah, no taste what so ever. The sheppards pie was over baked. So go here for the atmosphere but not the food!
The food was great. We had the ribs and chicken combo with corn and butterbeer. Definitely a place to dine if you are a Harry Potter fan. 
Although the food is nothing to write home about - it is all about the experience. Harry Potter Fans will revel in this restaurant. We had breakfast here and it wasn't anything great, but we will always remember marveling at the amazing environment - complete with butter beer!!! Loads of fun!
We made reservations at The Three Broomsticks but learned upon arrival that we had to stand in line with the rest of the guests. The man at the door stated that there were only 30 reservations that day so it was decided to make everyone wait in line....huh?! Not a great way to start off our breakfast. The line was about 20 minutes long. Once you place your order you move to another line to grab your food. Luckily, there were plenty of tables around for seating. The food was good. We had the All American Breakfast and Butterbeer. I would probably visit again....I just wouldn't bother making reservations. 
Unique fun place to eat for Harry Potter fans. We ate breakfast here -- while the breakfast is average fare, its definitely a must try if only for the atmosphere. I have been told that lunch and dinner are much better. 
We hit Three Broomsticks twice while we visited. The food was good, and it really seemed like the best value. The butter beer is over the top sweet but the pumpkin juice was enjoyable. 
I have been to the Three Broomsticks 2x. Once 4 years ago, and once in June. Both experiences were about the same. This is the only restaurant in the Wonderful World of Harry Potter. The atmosphere is great, awesome, so fun to look at. The food is okay. It is a cafeteria style restaurant. You wait in a long line to order, then wait for your food, then walk around looking for a place to sit and eat. The was the restaurant is set up, you are not really able to get in and scope for a table BEFORE you order. There were 6 of us at a 2 top table with most of us standing and eating. If you are looking for kid friendly food, with a cool atmosphere, go for it. If you are looking to sit, relax and enjoy your food, head to a different restaurant, or even better, go to the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley. It is the better for the 2 Harry Potter restaurants. I would recommend that one hands down! Food was great and they have hostesses to seat you and bring your food to your table. We had a party of 11 that day and were able to get our table and food in a timely matter!
"food was ordinary. Butter beer is great! It's quick service so you have to get your own food and find your own seats. A number of seats were ""reserved"" for the entire time we were there. You do feel like you are on the movie set. "
Great atmosphere, a must for a HP fan! I enjoyed the English breakfast. All detailed decorations were very nice.
10 yo said they were the best chicken fingers he'd ever had. All three of us enjoyed our meals.Adults enjoyed the roasted chicken, especially the corn on the cob. Later we happened to find the patio area behind the restaurant where we sat during a rainy period. It was great to get Hogs Head drinks and sit out there while resting our feet. We easily could've eaten here again if we'd been in that part of the park at the right time.
It's cafeteria style service which is functional as the place is really busy, but there's not much atmosphere here when you compare it to it's 'sister' the Leaky Cauldron. It's worth taking the Hogwarts Express to Diagon Alley to have your meal there instead.
Throw yourself into the fun, and have a frozen butterbeer! They are delicious! The rest is just to keep you going, and it's all good, typical English fare, just good, not great. But, the ambiance is fun, and it has a fantastic view of the castle, so enjoy!
Had the banquet for 4 which actually fed 6 of us easily .The butter beer is just to die for yummy yummy.
If staying at the parks this is definitely worth checking out for breakfast. The food is your average cafeteria type breakfast, however, the atmosphere and decor are not to be missed for Harry Potter Fans!
As I had written in several other reviews for Universal and Harry Potter wold, I love Harry Potter so I was really expecting amazing things which were more than fulfilled. We obviously HAD to eat at The Three Broomsticks! I got the butterbeer cold and it was so yummy! The turkey leg was good and the portions were bigger than I expected. The food is expensive but you are at a theme park! You need to come in expecting to spend $$$!Universal allows you to bring your own food so no one is forcing you to eat here! Also, the park hopper allows you to leave the park and eat at one of the restaurants at City Walk so keep that in mind. Staff were fantastic and you get a great view of Hogwarts from the back patio eating area!
Food was ok. Expensive, but in line with everything Universal. Worth it. The experience is nice. Try a butterbeer or better yet, the Pumpkin Juice! Nice and cool. Really friendly and helpful staff.
Yes, this restaurant in one of the Harry Potter areas has atmosphere, but the food is ordinary cafeteria stuff. Fish and chips were okay, but I got 4 fingers of fish--not much--and a pitiful amount of fries. Everything is tray, plastic, and out of squeezy packets. For a restaurant inside one of the gigundo parks, it was okay. They are all the same. If you're looking for something fancier, you have to go outside, either City Walk or Downtown Disney, but that's a whole other matter. Orlando itself also has lots and lots of good places to eat, but when you're in the park, it's fun to eat at one of the themed eateries. Prices were all that bad at this one, come to think of it.
As the title suggest I am the furthest thing from a fan, and also being a local universal is a quite often trip for me. On the other hand my wife has made me watch every single movie so I knew what the décor was suppose to be and may I say wow universal... great job on an extremely accurate representation. The food here is delicious.... The ribs and potatoes were literally heaven. only downside is no coke products at all, but oh well a lemonade will suffice. All in all it was a great restaurant.
This is a great place to grab lunch and get out of the sun for a little while during your visit to WWHP. The food portions are substantial but on the pricey side. This is a great option if you've purchased the meal plan since you will pay somewhere between $15-$20 per person depending on your food and beverage option. The food was good quality and definitely enough to fuel the average person for the remainder of a long day of WWHP 
We used this restaurant for some lunch while visiting the Harry Potter world at Islands of Adventure.I have to say that usually the food in the parks is much of a muchness, each outlet doing basically the same food but just branded differently to fit the location.However this place was branded as doing traditional English fare, and most of it was fair enough, but on the menu was Cornish Pasty, a number of our party fancied the Pasty with salad for lunch, but while all the other options were displayed as you queued, the Pasty wasn't and when it came up we could see why, it wasn't a proper Pasty but three of the 'mini' type pasty soften sold by high street supermarkets as snack food in the chiller cabinets, not what you expect for almost $9.
Food was good quality albeit a typical American breakfast.Good atmosphere and very intriguing attendants.Below average price for a themepark but above average comapred to a fastfood chain e.g. Denny's.
The food was excellent and the portions were beyond generous! This restaurant is one on the food plan that can be purchased in Universal.
Rustic furniture, giant cauldrons, smell of pumpkin pie and music background, all combined in one word - magic! Some times you can feel air movement as an owl flew upstairs... I love magic! 
We went for breakfast to keep the price down. Service was fast and efficient and the kids got their pumpkin juice (certified to sweet by them) and butterbeer (got raves) that they were dying to try. Eggs were a little overdone, but the rest was good. I had fresh fruit and it was very nicely done. However, you go for the experience and the ambience and my kids were absolutely thrilled with the experience of being in the Three Broomsticks. Staff was quite friendly. 
Yummy food - drinks selection different to the rest of the park and HP themed. Fab themed building. We loved it.
This is the best theme park food ever. We had the family feast and a turkey leg plate. We had a healthy and filling lunch. I would definitely go again. 
"Since ""everybody"" wants to visit Harry Potter in Universal Studios, you may as well have breakfast, lunch or dinner at this restaurant. For park standards, it has excellent choices at a good price and several plate offers that serves larger families. Also for those that look for a good bar offering, there is a separate bar where you find a variety of beers on tap and wine selection. What many people do not know that in case you just want to chill and sit in the shade....there is an outdoors/deck area in the back with view of Hogswart."
It was definitely overpriced for what you get. I recommend the turkey drumstick as it's substantial and not too expensive otherwise you will be paying a lot.
The food is not the star here. Honestly, if it didn't come with our hotel stay, we would only have stopped to take pictures. The food tastes just fine, but the guys in our group found the portions to be small. $15.99 per person if you have to pay for it.
We are Premier pass holders and go to Universal to eat dinner once or twice per week. The Three Broomsticks is a favorite. The food is well prepared, healthy choices are available, and the ambiance puts you right in the middle of Harry Potter's world. One caveat: this past weekend a drunk couple were in the restaurant. The female passed out at the table, and the male was belligerent to the staff. When the staff called Security for help, one guard appeared, asked the male to come with the guard, and then the guard left when the male guest refused to go. This left the restaurant staff on their own to deal with this problem couple. In over 50 dinners at this restaurant this is the first time I have witnessed such an event, but it left me concerned about Universal's security.
The food is great and the staff is amazing. Everyone is super friendly and willing to help at every moment. The roast chicken literally falls off the bone. The level of detail of the dining room is phenomenal. 
Great food when you want more of a full meal rather than fast food/theme park type fair. Cool outdoor seating area toward the back.
I was so impressed with the organization of this restaurant to handle large numbers of people and the dining experience was fantastic. My son loved the pumpkin juice and smoked turkey leg. The interior was Harry Potter themed, very well done. I did feel sorry for employees having to wear wool pants and snow caps on a 90 degree, humid day
The food was good and the service was streamlined. They know how to accommodate many people in a short period of time (unlike Richter, another restaurant in the park I visited the day before). The decor and food selections made me feel as if I could have been sitting beside Harry and the others. A little pricey, but that's expected when one visits a theme park. 
A fantastic place to get out of the Wizarding World traffic and enjoy a meal with friends and family! We got there early, before the lunch rush, as planned, and it worked out really well. With 10 people in our party, I thought we would have trouble finding a place to sit together, but the lovely folks working the dining room helped us and we all sat together at one large table by the fireplace. The food is good, but let's face it, you're there for the ambiance. The place is amazing. Some many details to soak in and point out to your friends. The folks working there NEVER break character, so you're totally immersed in another world. Want a beer or a mixed drink? Head to the wall on the far right of the food service area to find the Hog's Head Pub. I've been told the Hog's Head Brew is great and you can get a cool souvenir mug, similar to the Butterbeer mugs except slightly bigger and with the Hog's Head logo. When you leave, head out the back door for some little hidden gems detailing this often-overlooked alleyway.
A fabulous experience, quick, friendly service, varied menu, some great deals and good prices. Delicious food with amazing surrounds of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.Very busy, popular with children, prepare to queue.
The setting was fantastic. The food was ok but what can you expect for this type of fast food. The ribs were good. The chicken was hit or miss. Mine was very dry but my sons's was moist but undercooked. The chicken is smoked so you will get that red look but this was more bloody. They were VERY nice and graciously replaced his meal with another chicken.Service was fast and efficient even though we were there at a peak time.
We had lunch here on a very busy hot day in August. We arrived at about 1130 and were glad as it filled up fast after that. Slightly odd setup with no prices on the menu. You order from one desk and collect food from another. Very interesting building and deliciously cool on a hot day! Food was reasonably priced and good quality. Staff were all polite and helpful. We had the Shepherds Pie, Spare Ribs and Kids Chicken Fingers. Deserts, similarly good although the Apple Pie was improved with some spare ice cream from one of the kids! Definitely recommended but get there early for lunch! 
We got the rib plate and it was wonderful! The ribs were very tinder and fell off the bone. The tables are very close together but overall it was a great!
This is an experience, while it is busy the staff help you progress through and find a table quickly. Great BBQ food and some classics in an old English setting. The family feast for 4 is great value and feeds 4-6 adults easily with 4 half rack of ribs, 4 BBQ chicken quarters, a pile of roast potatoes, roast veggies, 4 corn on the cobs, corn bread and a huge salad. The bar is well stocked and you can get butter beer from there much quicker than the cart outside. Sit outside when the temp is not too hot, inside for the atmosphere and a/c in the heat of the day.
We liked being able to have breakfast at the park. The set up was a bit odd. They did have staff directing you to where to order..but the pick up was odd. Also it was very crowded and we ended up sharing our table with another couple. Felt very cafeteria like. Food was okay but not something I would recommend or anything special. We did feel the price was reasonable for being in the park.
Good place to get full English breakfast. Lovely feel to it and the interior is quite rustic and fits in well with the Harry Potter theme. 
We were completely over the fast food. This restaurant offers a good meal reasonably priced. You enter and stand in a line to place your order and pay. Then you are called to another window to pick up your food. Once you have your tray of food you go to the dining area where you will be seated by a hostess. No long wait here either, even though the place was packed. The line was long, however the wait was much faster than I expected. they have people guiding you along as you go. they have menus before you actually get up to the front of the line, so you can make your decision ahead of time. We choose the half baked chicken with redskin potatoes (which were delicious) and a ear of corn, the cost for this was $10.95, for a theme park this was a deal. We enjoyed the meal and it gave us a place to relax for a bit before heading back out.
This place is amazing, kids loved it and service excellent, the decor and atmosphere was brilliant , we had breakfast which was lovely.
Food was just ok. We booked in advance and prepaid. Breakfast was $18pp and included a small drink. Breakfast is prepared and you pick up at the window. English style, Western style or a pancake breakfast. Western style: bacon and link sausage, scrambled eggs, red potatoes and a croissant. Eastern style: Included a tomato, baked beans and blood sausage. Really, just average. Not a great meal for such a price. If you skip this, no worries, you're not missing out. Just go elsewhere in HP world and get a Butter Beer!
We ended our visit here at the Hogs head cafe having a red ale and sharing butter beer. My grown children and I appreciated the atmosphere and truly a European pub feeling. Sorry, but we didn't try the food... But the red ale(their own brew) and the atmosphere was a neat experience. My son just returned from Europe this past week, and he really wanted to sit in here for a while and enjoy the ambience.
I really wanted to like this, as its part of Harry Potter land and was brilliantly themed, but the food was bland and greasy. Later in the day might be better, but give breakfast a miss.On the other hand, staff were great, very helpful.
We had both breakfast and dinner at the Three Broomsticks. Breakfast was included as part of our hotel package - otherwise I'd consider it a little pricey. The food quality was very good, though, and it included some cold butterbeer or pumpkin juice as part of the deal. Dinner was also quite good. I had the fish and chips and the fish was very well done (this from a veteran of dozens of Wisconsin Friday Fish dinners!) For the price, one more piece would have been appreciated. My wife had the chicken and ribs dinner. The chicken was good, but you can skip the ribs. Atmosphere, like all things in Hogsmeade, was very authentic. The room was crowded, though, and you'd better be fine sitting with strangers - or at least at elbow touching distance. Employees were very helpful and in character. That was fun. It really is a must stop for Harry Potter fans!
The food is pretty darn good for being park food. I felt like I was part of Harry's world when I ate here. There are shadows and noises of house elves and hotel guests, which makes it a lot of fun to eat at. The Hog's Head pub is right next to it which is great as well. Def worth the stop for any HP fan.
Interesting to walk through and the food was oka,y but I would pass next time. Plenty of ither places to eat, but the ButterBeer is a must. 
The food was decent, hot and flavorful. Portion size for the chicken may feed 2 small kids so that could save you money. Although they say they have healthy selections- it was just blah for those who try not to go overboard and save their calories for something like BUTTERBEER! Price was high for what you get but when held prisoner to a theme park- it was expected.
We really enjoyed our meal at The Three Broomsticks. Our family of four had the Family Feast- there was plenty of food and more than enough salad. The broccoli was especially tasty. The atmosphere is really nice too.We visited around the dinner hour and also during a rainy period- we did not have to wait long at all.The drinks are a bit pricey but where else can you get pear cider, pumpkin juice, and butter beer? Yum!
For theme park fare, its good. Theme is excellent, or even better than that. Butterbeer is best dessert going. 
 When it was pouring, we sheltered in the three broomsticks. The food was fantastic. Also the workers were very helpful and kind, especially Xevia. I just wanted to say thank you for making this dining experience extraordinary. Definitely going to recommend to people and come back with my family. Thank you for your time. 
Great place, you really feel like your part of the film, great staff very helpful, great fast food, a must eat.
It began to ran so we thought we would run over to the three broom sticks, only to have to wait 20 mins in the rain before we could even enter the building, then you finally get through the doors only to have to cue for another 20 minutes. seeing the cue I thought I'd go grab a table for my family and was approached by two different staff members who made me feel like a child and told me I wasn't allowed to sit down at the table without any food which I don't get cus what if my friends was ordering food and I didn't want any so i then had to rejoin the cue. It's moves very slowly however when I did get to the front I was served by Andy who was welcoming helpful and very polite. When then got our food which is about $15 and I have to say it was worth it, it was cold by the time we came to eat because once you get your food you also have to be directed where to see however they were quick at doing this so I believe the food was just cold to begin with. On the whole I think it's very authentic but if I was to suggest where to eat I would say walk back to city walk as all these restaurants inside the theme parks taste very basic and overpriced. Disappointing food for a lovely Harry Potter feel restaurant. 
Like being in the movie... We sat here when it was hot out and just enjoyed the sites and sounds. Food was fabulous too.
We had breakfast at The Three Broomsticks. I had the American Breakfast, my son had the Pancake Breakfast, and my mom had a fruit cup. Everything was fresh and tasted great. My son found out he likes butterbeer and I found out I do not like Pumpkin Juice. Since the drink is included in the meal, it's a good place to try something different.
Very good food.. Had to wait about 15 or 20 minutes to get in... They are very organized there however.. No tthat long to wait considering how long the ride and attraction lines were.
Went here for lunch. Very tasty! I had fish and chips and I must say it was the nicest fish I've had in a long time. My daughter had half-roast chicken with roast potatoes and veg and my husband had cottage pie. We left nothing - it was so good. Perhaps a bit pricey but you have to expect higher prices in the parks. We all had Butterbeer to drink. That is a must when iin HP World. Butterbeer is a type of fizzy drink which has a taste of sickly sweet, butterscotch cream soda. We found it too sweet but the drink is in keeping with the theme from the books. The staff here were very welcoming and friendly.
Enjoyed our lunch here although the 'Cornish Pasties' are not anything like the real thing, they are quite tasty though. Shepherds Pie also quite nice. Very very busy at lunchtime but didn't feel rushed in any way. A must for all Harry Potter fans.
We enjoyed breakfast here on the second morning of our vacation. We did not make a reservation. We arrived shortly after it opened. We walked right up and ordered. The breakfast was great and portion size was big. We love the atmosphere of this restaurant. The food was very good and we even skipped lunch this day because we stayed full. Highly recommend during your visit to Hogsmeade!
You feel like you're in the Harry Potter movies!! Lots of little things to look for in the rafters, keeps the time spent in here interesting. I ordered the Cornish Pasties with a garden salad. The salad was good size, and came with a packaged dressing on the side. The Cornish Pasties were good, but small. And the seasoning was different from what I normally eat, so while good I probably wouldn't get these again. Just a matter a preference. I also ordered a Pumpkin Juice to try, and it's pretty sweet for my taste. I personally prefer frozen Butterbeer, which can also be purchased here on top of your normal sodas and a few other drinks. My husband ordered the Fish and Chips, and was given a good size portion. Lots of tables to sit at - an employee will seat you once you have your food. The decorations are really great, a love everything about this area of the park. 
We love the graphics on the walls and the butter beer! There is a really cool, shaded area out behind it in front of a lake overlooking the castle. My favorite part of a day at universal is to sit down, relax back there, and have a nice, cold butterbeer.
This place is amazing. It offers a different variety of foods that our table ate a little of everything and nothing was bad! It looks like a wait however they do get you in and out quickly. Sit and relax.
Came here to eat Lunch and enjoyed it very much. Quick service and lovely staff. Will eat here again.
Enjoyed the options in this restaurant. The staff was very friendly. All food is pricey at Universal, but this is a fun experience and you are going to spend the money eating anyway. 
The Three Broomsticks offers a good value, if slightly rushed, eating experience. We ate here twice during our Holiday, on one occasion having to queue outside, the second making it straight in to the inside queue. However, the time in the queue allows you to see the menu (and models of the actual dishes) before reaching the order point.We settled for the Chicken Feast for4, which included roast chicken, ribs and corn on the cob with a selection of vegetable and a side salad. This represented good value, particularly given you were in a Theme Park. We all took Butterbeer for our drink, which is similar to cream soda, with a very creamy head.The hardest working staff are those charged with locating free tables, as you are held at the server, before being guided to your table. This is a large restaurant (with extra seating outside), but with it being very popular, there is a constant churn of people - not a relaxing atmosphere and no option for an extended stay at your table in an air con environment.Since our last visit, the restaurant has been expanded to include a bar, selling a range of beers from around the world, which is entered by its own door, but we didn't have time to try it out.
My daughter is a huge Harry Potter fan. The atmosphere in this restaurant made you feel as though the characters could walk by at any moment.
We went to Three Broomsticks for my son. The short line started outside but then when we got inside there was a longer line. Face palm. We waited for about 15 minutes to order. There's a line for everything related to Mr. Harry Potter. We decided to get the Family Feast for 4 with two young kids. It came with 4 pieces of roasted chicken, BBQ ribs and corn on the cob. Also included veggie mix of peppers, carrots and potatoes and a huge garden salad. I really wasn't expecting much but the food was actually good. Usually amusement park for is over salted and greasy but this feast was well prepared and properly seasoned for our taste. Our family was stuffed and enjoyed the meal and the scenery. 
We have always been at Hogsmeade early in the morning and been keen to try food just to experience everything. However, there has always been a large queue of people who have booked breakfast as part of a package. I have to say they always seem to be disgruntled at the long wait. However, you can instead enter the building to the right hand side of the restaurant which takes you into the Hog's head bar where you can buy butterbeer: alcoholic or non alcoholic. It never seemed to me that the Hog's head was connected to the Three Broomsticks in the books so this immediately spoils the authenticity for me. Additionally, sometimes a strange rule has been enforced that you cannot sit in the building just with drinks , which has been a catch 22 as you cannot order food because of the large queue for the breakfast package. There is a nice little terrace out back with tables with sun umbrellas which is quite pleasant to sit at and gives you a little breather from the crowd. Even stranger, last time we were there we were allowed to order food from the self service even though there seemed to be the usual queue outside for breakfast. No idea how this was possible on this occasion and not every other time but the breakfast was OK and we were allowed to sit inside. All the confusion over what is and isn't allowed completely spoils any chance of really enjoying the surroundings.
The good: Pretty good family fare for a major theme park. There was ample variety and portions were appropriate - probably a little carb heavy. The food seemed fresh with fresh ingredients for it being mass produced for a audience that usually should have had lunch break a half hour earlier before the got Grumpy (Wait - that's Disney ...can I say that here!?!)The Not so Good but I have no solutions: Nothing like having lunch with a couple hundred people that I will never exchange Xmas cards with! It was packed and we were not even there during prime time. The tables are close together - no intimate dining here. We ate up and surged forward....
Food was good...service was great...the boar's head on the wall grunts when you talk to it or approach the bar,
Being Harry Potter fans we had to try the butterbeer. It is very sweet and the flavor didn't really appeal to any of us in the family. Also not very refreshing on a hot day! Better to buy just one and everyone share a sip to say they have tried it. However, I would highly recommend butterbeer flavored ice cream at Fortescues!
If you want to see it just get a drink or sneak in the back way. The food was dreadful - probably the worst I have had, ever, and that is saying something - and expensive. Cornish pastries should be banned under the trade descriptions act although the fish was marginally better. And don't get butterbeer for everyone unless you know what to expect. It's not for most people judging by the expressions but what a gimmick! At least it's the same as in the UK so true to brand.
The food here is delicious and of great value. We do the family feast, $50 and way more food then you will need for 4 people! We bring baggies with us so we can bring the leftovers home or continue to snack on throughout the rest of the day in the park. The potatoes are delicious, but the roast chicken is mouthwatering, and the ribs... wow... Seriously great food for a great value.
"We went for a beer each, (butter beer for the kids!) and queued, ordered and collected our drinks, before queuing again to be seated. The cast member was really rude and barked at us .. ""Have you actually got any food!"" - we didn't have, but after spending over $20 on drinks wanted to sit and enjoy them. On a boiling hot 100 degrees day in Florida a sit in the air con would have been fab. The theming looked really good, in line with the rest of the park, but we weren't allowed in, even though it was half empty and full of spaces, simply because we bought no food. Really disappointed and left a sour taste, especially after the drinks cost so much. "
Great food! Family feast for 4 is well worth the price. Sit and relax. Atmosphere is very intriguing.
"We stopped here for a snack and to get out of the heat, and ended up coming back for supper. We had ""The Feast,"" which was rotisserie chicken, bbq ribs, corn on the cob, roasted potatoes, and mixed veggies for 4 people. It was wonderful, especially the chicken, corn, potatoes, and veggies, and there was more than enough food for us. The ribs were quite dry, but it was late so they may have been sitting in the warmer too long. The chicken was juicy and flavorful, and the potatoes and veggies as well. I really enjoyed this meal--very unexpected for a walk-up place at a theme park."
My family eats at The Three Broomsticks every time we visit. The food and service is great but you can't beat the décor and ambiance.
For a theme park restaurant we were very pleased. the food was VERY GOOD. We got the 4 person feast. And it is a bargain in any restaurant much less a theme park. We wanted to go there for the Harry Potter experience but you can go there for the food as well. Oh and I was very surprised how good butter beer actually tasted
"If you're a family of 4 - I highly recommend getting 'The Feast"" it makes more sense economically and the variety can't be beat. Also the roasted potatoes were to die for! Waiting to get the food after it was ordered and paid for was a mess, though. A better system has to be put in place."
The food is nothing special and it has an English pub menu but you have to go if your looking for the whole Harry Potter immersive experience. As it gets very crowded, I recommend going at 11:30 for lunch and 4:30 for dinner to beat the crowds. Fun fact- make sure to look for Dobby's shadow on the upstairs wall!
Loved this place! Massive fan of potter and it was great to feel like we were there! It was also my birthday and we got a free desert...yum! Only bad thing is the plastic plates and cutlery...makes it hard to cut the food 
The theme is well maintained thoughout this resturant and it had a good feel about it and we were surprised to find it quiet inside and the prices reasonable - until we ate. The portion sizes are ridiculously small and the quality is poor. I had pasties and salad which was just about OK but my family had chicken and fries. The chicken was dry and they only had five rather sad looking fries. Perhaps we were unlucky but these three witches will not be back. There are much better resturants elsewhere in the park so I suggest you park your broomsticks elsewhere for lunch.
"I have never written a bad review but ""The Three Broomsticks"" was the worst food I have ever had the privilege of spending 60USD's on. It is really very very poor. Service and the line was ok but the food was chuck in the fryer stuff. I would rather go to Denny's and eat there, in fact I would give Denny's a Michelin star so make your assessment from that. Avoid like the plague! Felt ill after it."
From what our daughter told me it was like eating in the dining hall from the books....the food however was average...by wizard standards of course.And rather expensive.
Overpriced and just OK food. Not well executed which is not on-par with the excellent Universal Experience, especially within Happy Potter's world.
The food was expensive as is the case in ALL of the adventure parks where they have hostages that get hungry. The wait in line was reasonably short and filling the order was fast. Food quality was fair to good depending on what you order.
"We only went in for a Butter Beer but it was awesome! From the employees being in ""character"" to the decor. It made us feel like we were characters in the movie. The Butter Beer was great too! "
I have a policy in not publishing any bad reviews at all, but this one deserves it! Bad service, the worst attention we ever had. Food was garbage, expensive, I rather take a Mc Donalds instead of this junk! I ordered a turkey leg and the meat was raw, it felt like you were eating hard skin. They served my beer warm, I know some types of beers taste better in warmer temperatures, but this was not the case. The service was slow and the prices is ridiculous for the type of junk meal you get. The food gave us stomach ache and almost ruined our magnificent trip to this beautiful park. The park has better places to eat and cheaper. Please avoid it all costs!
the three broomsticks looks like it came right out of the harry potter movies! Not only does it look like it does in the movie but the food is amazing! I had the Turkey Leg and Potato wedges! it was so good! this is a great place for family meal! a little high priced and the line is very long, but it is a good choice! 
Went there twice on different days and I must say that the food is affordable and tasty for theme park restaurant. The place looks great and take your time looking at all the details and those videos animations that appears on the walls from time to time. The food portions are generous (beside the fries that look lonely) and the chicken is moist and tasty. I enjoyed the chicken salad with the balsamic vinaigrette dressing or the raspberry vinaigrette dressing. Apple cider is just apple juice don't expect to have an alcoholic beverage. The service is fast and the staff was very efficient. The best part is that you don't have to look for a table. When you picked up your food, they will seat you. I never had to wait for a table. Watch out the place is often crowded and if you are going there during high season, avoid the rush hours by going there outside meals hours.
I am the biggest Harty Potter fan so this was a must for us. So after an early start to the park we hopped on platform 9 3/4 and headed to Hogsmead on the Hogwarts Express to have breakfast here. The service was incredibly slow and everything served on plastic with plastic knives and forks. The food was average at best. We both had the American Breakfast and the scrambled eggs came colder than an ice cube. The coffee accompanying was u drinkable - licking the road would have had a better taste. From an aesthetic point of view and to fully experience every aspect of Harry Potter this is worth a stop by to have a look but eat elsewhere. 
Interesting to look at the inside. Quite well thought out. We went early and there was very little queue.
We didn't make a reservation and went to see if we could get in for breakfast and was surprised to be able to get a table. So glad we did as it was wonderful! The atmosphere was great food was great although not a proper English breakfast but still delicious! Well priced and just a great experience can't wait to go next time!
Fun experience and atmosphere. Food is very good, too. Especially for a theme park. We had breakfast there as part of our resort package. 
So you need to realize that this is an excellent rating for theme park food. That being said, we ate there for breakfast. I chose the English porridge breakfast. It was delicious, warm and filling. My husband also had an English themed breakfast which he enjoyed. We did receive a lot of food for the dollar, which is great at a theme park. I wanted to go back for an afternoon meal, but my daughter didn't want to try anything that wasn't American. I would definitely eat there again!
Loved the decorum and atmosphere! I felt like I had been transported into the Harry Potter books! The shadows of house elves moving along the second floor were a nice touch! Would definitely eat there again!
I really wanted to eat in one of the Harry Potter themed restaurants, and was totally surprised by how affordable The Three Broomsticks happened to be. The quality of the food was surprising too. Delicious rotisserie style chicken platter and a variety of Harry Potter specific drinks. The atmosphere was great and made you feel like you were right in Hogsmede
We got the Great Feast for our family of four. We were starving, and it was actually a feast! There was more than enough for al four of us, and it was all very good. The atmosphere is very fun, too!
So unlike anything else you will get at the park - there were 4 of us - 2 parents and 2 of our kids - 4 quarter chickens - 4 rib sections - 2 full ears of corn to cut - a load of mixed vegetables, roasted potates, and a large, ice cold, mixed salad for...... get this...... under $50. It was unreal. Did I mention the food was actually very good as well? Quality and quantity and a screaming value relative to other options at the park. If you have to eat at the park, this is where you want to do it. Décor? An A+ as well.
Having lunch here was fun!! Loved how it looked and the food was good as well. I had the roasted chicken and it was delicious (moist and very tasty).
I just had to eat at the three broomsticks, my kids love all things Harry Potter and this was no exception. Luckily for me I only discovered you could buy a beer at the park on the last day or I would have been in the pub the whole trip
Food is pretty good, but expensive. Of course that is normal for a theme park eatery. Very busy. We had to hold our trays while the hostess found seating for us. That much food was pretty heavy to hold for several minutes.
Very surprised by the food selection here. The fish & chips were delicious. But even better is that there is a bar in the back that serves butter beer and a real beer made just for the restaurant. Very cool idea. Felt like we in the movie.
Any potter fan will love this. The bar/restaurant is faithfully replicated. You feel like you are in the book. We went right before the park closed and it was so cool in the shadows. Food is ok, price is moderate but you go for the atmosphere. 
The food at Three Broomsticks was quite good, there was plenty of it and as a celiac sufferer, I appreciated that there were numerous gluten-free choices. However, the tables and chairs are an odd lot. Our table seemed very high for our chairs - but it does make for atmosphere!
My daugher and I could not wait to eat here while visiting the park. I am a vegetarian so there wasn't much for me. We did not like the things we did order. It was fun though.
I had the chicken salad. It was o.k., plenty of roasted chicken, but nothing overly special. My husband had the chicken meal, two others had the Cornish pasties, and another had the ribs. We all had Butterbeer at 5.00 each. Way too expensive, but delightful. The food was just o.k. but definitely not bad.
Loved our visit to the Three Broomsticks. We felt like we were really a part of a magical community drinking Butterbeer and watching the world go by. Fantastic stop on a fantastic trip!
The decor, atmosphere, food, staff were all great. A lot of fun. You get a lot of food for your money. Well worth it. You will not leave hungry.
We had lunch here and the food was really yummy! I myself had the shepherds pie which was great. The only thing I did not like the day we went was that it was really crowded and they were out of some menu items but of course we went at prime time. We felt like we were part of Harry Potter!
It was a hot, muggy day amidst thunderstorms and we were hungry and wet. Having fun and try to act like we weren't the muggles that we are, we stopped into the fine Hogsmead eatery, The Three Broomsticks. It can get very busy but the staff hanles it well. The meals run from between $10-$15. We had the Chicken/Ribs combo, Turkey Leg and the Roast Chicken. The chicken moist, my oldest raved about the turkey, smoked and moist! The ribs fell off the bone and the sauce had a good tang to it. Each meal had fried potatoes or fries some got roasted corn on the cob also. When topped off with a butter beer or cider we really enjoyed it. Their are other options if you want.
I wanted to eat at The Three Broomsticks because I am a huge HP fan, and just so I could say I had eaten there. Well, each person in my family of four ordered something different; rib plate, roasted chicken plate, the fish plate, and the pasties. The fish plate could have been straight from Captain D's or Long John Silver. The pasties were not that good...tasted like they came from a box. The rib plate was okay, but was not high quality ribs. However, the chicken was good, as was the corn on the cob. The potatoes that came with the chicken and the rib plates are okay, depending on the herbs you like. The drinks are expensive and not refillable. There are no fountain sodas available here. Of all the places in Universal, we loved the atmosphere, but the food wasn't worth the price we paid. We expected it to be expensive, and we were prepared for that considering most theme parks have outrageously priced food.Ordering was very easy. You wait in line and there are menus along the way. The attendant tells you which cashier to go to and you order there and then go to the same numbered order pick up. Then someone seats you. They are very quick to clean up right after a person so that the next party can have a table.
"Share ""The Feast"" you will not go away hungry or disappointed. The warm cinnamon baked mini apple pie is to die for!"
the food here was much better then the leaky cauldron! much larger portions here. also the attention to detail and how everything was set up and run was really great! had absolutely no complaints about anything here!
Our family of 5 had what was one of our cheapest and most healthy dinners here. We ordered the great feast on our last night at Universal and it was a very good. The roasted chicken and vegtables were such a welcomed change from the fast food options the kids had been living on. It was also fairly inexpensive, especially when you see all of the food it included. It says that it feeds 4, but in our case it fed all 5 with extra salad and sides left over. If your kids were teenagers, you'd probably need the add a person option.The atmosphere is fun for Harry Potter fans. If you are not, it's still a neat tavern feel. Lastly, always good to know, there is a bar on the other side of the main room from the food line that offers regular brews and the Harry Potter beers. 
Again...this is a part of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. If you're a HP fan, you will not be disappointed in anything here. The food is good and the service is awesome! You really feel like you're in HP's world....
We ate here 2 different times. The first was fish and chips which was excellent, the second was ribs which was a little dry. My daughter had the shepherds pie, which was excellent. A little pricey but a lot of food.
The inside is beautiful and had a lot of though put into the decor. While the food options are minimal, the Fish and Chips, were delicious. The tables had enough room for everyone to sit at them.I recomend that you don't get into the line to enter The Three Broomsticks because if you wait an hour or two it clears up and you can go right to the cashier, but if you need a time guess I would say don't go looking for food from 11am to 2pm as that is when most people eat. And because most people are eating then, it makes the lines shorter for the rides, and you can walk down the street faster without all the people there.
The food here was just ok, Although the Butter beer was amazing. Unfortunately a glass of butter beer was spilled as we were sitting down. The staff stood there and watched as my wife was covered in the drink and cleaned up the mess. The bartender was the only one to show concern about my wife being possibly burned from the hot liquid being spilled on her. I believe they may need to take some tips from the disney parks in terms of customer service..
We loved having breakfast here, which was included in our package price along with the Leaky Cauldron. Just like everything else in the wizarding world of Harry Potter, nothing was spared in creating an authentic atmosphere. We truly believed we were eating in the Three Broomsticks, and expected to see Hagrid come through the door at any minute!! The food was average, the hot butterbeer amazing, but the true reason to come here is just to experience the place itself!
"This well themes tavern in WWoHP is where visitors to Hogsmeade come to dine on fare inspired by the movies and books. The restaurant serves the ""Great Feast Platter,"" fish and chips, shepherd's pie, soup, salads, pumpkin juice and Butterbeer, plus tasty desserts including apple pie and chocolate trifle.Cuisine: Fish and chips, shepherd's pie, Cornish pasty, turkey legs and fresh vegetables Children's Menu: Chicken, macaroni cheese, fish and chips, and chicken fingers, each served with grapes and applesauce. Service Type: Buffeteria Dining Hours: Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner daily In the back of the Three Broomsticks is the Hog's Head pub. On the wall behind the bar is a large stuffed hog's head which periodically snarls at guests. Your group or family can enjoy favorites from the books and movies including Butterbeer, pumpkin juice and other beverages while adults trade stories and sample the pub's selection of domestic and imported beers, specialty drinks, wine, spirits and mixed drinks."
The food here I consider to be okay. We had the roasted chicken with potatoes and corn. It was edible but the chicken was very dry. There is a very limited menu so make sure to view this if you have small children or picky eaters. Also, soft drinks are not served here - water, lemonade, butter beer, and tea.
"After gaining early admission to the Park and surviving the Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey attraction, we were ready for some breakfast. The first clue should have been that they were having trouble with their coffee machine. The second clue should have been when the photo of their ""English Breakfast"" had a croissant in it and not toast. $34 dollars later (2 English breakfasts, milk, orange juice), we indeed had sustenance in us but that was it. Never to return!On one positive note, the inside decor was very much in character for an old pub. On the back deck, there is a great view of the Castle (photo opp!!) but smokers were sneaking out there to smoke illegally, just adding to our negative experience."
It was just like stepping into the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Good food, friendly staff, and amazing atmosphere.
We enjoyed this quick stop for early lunch and had no wait to enter. Without having to leave this area of the park added to the enjoyment. Food was American menu but was great for a quick bite to eat.
We were looking for some lunch at Hogsmeade. We only had to wait for 10 minutes to be seated. I was surprised to have to pre-order the food, pay, wait for the order to be filled, then seated. However, it all flowed smoothly though and the food was great and the service was outstanding. I believe the restaurant was actually used in one of the Harry Potter films making it even more special.
Good place for a drink. Of course if our a Harry Potter fan its also a must. Round the back there is a seating area with an overview of different directions of the park, great place to recoup. we did so several times!
If you are a Harry Potter fan, then you need to eat breakfast at The Three Broomsticks restaurant inside Hogsmeade in Islands of Adventure. It is as if you are transported into the movie. The food is very good, and the experience is amazing. I suggest making a reservation ahead of time, but if there is room you can get in without a reservation.
Butterbeer, american breakfasts and a fun place to eat.Did not enjoy the 'blood pudding' apparently as 2 were left on the table
Fun! Worth going once. The turkey leg was great! The Cornish Pasties were OK. The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because - in my opinion - the Leaky Cauldron has better service and I liked the food better. Primarily you are going for the atmosphere - and the air-conditioned place to sit!
This place was put together really well. We didn't make it to the Leaky Cauldron for comparison, but this was quite the experience.We went early (~11:30am) before the lunch crowd hit, and it was easy to get in and sit down. Looks like they get packed pretty quickly, so I'd suggest going early if you don't care to wait long (or make a reservation).Food is English. Fish & chips (they don't resemble french fries... just potatoes) was good, and the half chicken was really good. I was surprised by the food quality for a theme park. It's not cheap, but for what you're getting you don't feel entirely ripped off.I had my first butterbeer here (they also have real beer!). It takes away from the experience ever-so-slightly that they default to the disposable plastic cups for serving it, but it's really pretty good. Never cared for butterscotch, but I thought this was a nice treat.Service was really good. Very efficient seating system (you order at a counter and pick up your food, but you're told where to go). Even if you're a couple of adults, I think this place is pretty neat and worth a try.
This is a must when visiting Hogsmeade at Universals Wizarding World! The food is great, we ate here several times. I had bangers & mash, & the mini pie combo (fishermans pie, & cottage pie) and of course Butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks. It feels as if you've quite literally stepped into Harry Potter's world and are dining in Hogsmeade village. Not so much like you are at a theme park attraction in Florida. Enjoyable experience & cannot wait to go back!
Loved going in here. This is the only restaurant in the two Harry Potter parks we had a chance to go into and we loved it. We wish we had a chance to go to the Leaky Cauldron too.The food was good, but seemed like it was the same food served in the rest of the park too. We went here for breakfast and had to deal with the confusion of the Universal Dining plan here, so that kind of made it a bad first impression. But we got to take lots of pictures and the people working here were pleasant and even pointed out great photo ops.Butterbeer is very sweet!
We went there as part of our Harry Potter package for breakfast one day. We had already done the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley. But the set up and the food were even better than teh Cauldron. The kids loved the pancakes, my wife got the traditional English Breakfast and I had the American, everything was very good. Especially for a cafeteria style place.
Loved the environment! The menu items are fun, but stick to what you know you will like. This is a must for lunch, or dinner while visiting Hogsmeade! Spolier!!- beware that Butterbeer tastes a lot like butterscotch! 
I got the half chicken meal. The potatoes was cooked just right. I tasted some of my friend's meat pie. It was great! as for the prices of both meals. It was really good.
Food isn't as good as in Diagon Alley (it's fine, just not great), and the way you have to serve and clear yourself would be fine if you ate there first, but we were in Diagon alley first and it just was more consistently good service and in character. I'd eat across the park if you can.
Had a great frozen butterbeer and cottage pie! Rowling made sure all the details of these parks make you feel like you're in the books with her characters.
The food was ok. We had shepherd's pie, which came with a nice salad. The kids enjoyed their fish and chips. Of course we all had butter beer, which you have to try. The atmosphere made this an enjoyable meal. They have an organized system for serving customers. 
Tried two of the platters - excellent value for a theme park!Left feeling full and wanting more.Very busy but didn't wait long to sit after getting out food however there was only 2 of us.
"There is a real ""coolness factor"" to dining in Three Broomsticks in Hosgmeade. For those looking for that immersive Harry Potter experience, it will be a must-do when visiting Islands of Adventure at Universal Orlando Resort.The food quality exceeded our expectations, with the chicken being flavorful and tender and the corn on the cob truly excellent. The sliced potatoes were a nice change from the expected french fries. Ice cold Butterbeer was a delicious accompaniment that makes dining within the Wizarding World worthwhile all on its own.The atmosphere and theming is superbly done, with no detail spared. Service was quick and efficient, with our meals ready to take to a table almost as soon as we were done covering the bill. A discount on the entire meal was happily applied by the team member at the cash upon presentation of our annual pass.These two muggles were more than satisfied!"
We got the Bbq chicken and ribs. They were fine. Nothing special. Not bad. Pricey. But what you'd expect for a theme park. You can also get an ok salad 
The environment was great, but food was so-so. Roasted potatoes were great. Butterbeer was delicious. Didn't know about veggie options until after ordering our final time, but service was very good.
The fish and chips are so good we had them for dinner 2 days in a row. We'd probably have them on our 3rd day but it rained really hard and we got soaked so had to go back to the hotel. :(
Perfect for the location, just like being part of the movie, can dine inside or out with a perfect view of Hogwart's Castle. Plus a bar with butterbeer and unique local brews
Breakfast at the The three Broomsticks was part of our package, and it was quite good. The place was crowded, but the lines moved quickly, and since we had reserved a table, we didn't have to wait at all. I had pancakes, and my son and husband had the American Breakfast. The hot butterbeer was delicious, but very filling. All in all, a good experience. 
Very unique if you are a Harry Potter Fan. Lots of people in this very busy place but it was well run and organized. The breakfast was very good for a theme park restaurant. We all had different things. Did try the butter beer, was not that impressed but you do have to try it!
If you go to Hogsmeade, you have to visit the Three Broomsticks for lunch or dinner. And if you are to have a meal there, I would recommend the Fish and Chips (nicely battered and fried to golden colour). And it's a pretty good portion too! If you are visiting with a large group of people, there is a feast menu that you can order. Of course you can also order butter beer (which is soda + vanilla whipped cream) and pumpkin juice - it's a hit or miss with these drinks, you either love it or hate it. Nonetheless, I would recommend this restaurant!
The food was good and we lucked out and found a table for 7. When it started to rain it was next to impossible to find room, glad we made it before the rain. 
We always eat at Three Broomstick when we go to Universal. The restaurant is so cool -look up to see stairways to nowhere! Get the fish and chips and get there early, around 11, to avoid the rush.
There is nothing to dislike. The breakfast was delicious. We didn't know we were needed to be escorted by a greeter before sitting. We just sat anywhere that looked comfortingly quiet. The Butterbeer was everyone's favorite that we had to purchase the mug outside of the restaurant. I highly recommend adding the breakfast to your package if your staying on site. It saves you time and effort. 
Food was good and given options of American or English breakfast. English breakfast includes blood sausage, but it was ok. Atmosphere is great and it's fun to just look around. 
This restaurant is hands down the best restaurant at the Universal parks in Orlando. Not only was the atmosphere spectacular, but the food was reasonably priced (better priced than Disney) and the taste was pretty good. Be sure to try the themed drinks! Butterbeer was on everyone's list in my 11 people party but all of us ended up hating it so I would personally suggest the Pumpkin Fizz which is basically carbonated pumpkin juice, or the ciders they offer. As for food, they are very generous with the portions and they are themed to be British food. I had a smoked turkey leg and it was very good. Others had fish and chips and the pot pie and all enjoyed the food immensely. The theming of the restaurant is great and there is even a staff member to seat you after you get you food at the counter so you are basically guaranteed a seat.
My family of 5 ate here during our first visit to Universal. We shared the family feast meal which says it feed 4 but it was plenty of food for us. We even had food left over. Great theming for my Harry Potter loving kids. Would eat here again. 
Ate here 3 times, twice for breakfast and once for dinner. The atmosphere is amazing. You really feel like you are in Hogsmeade. As for the food we really enjoyed it. Better than any of the other places we ate during are trip. Also the coffee is amazing!
We ate our fish and chips and chicken strips and frozen butterbeers on the back patio, with the Hogwarts castle as our view. Amazing!
This place is cafeteria style. you place and pay for your order and then go to another wicket to pick it up. everyone was very friendly. They found us seats in a rather packed restaurant very quickly. food was ok. salads were tasteless. My husband had the Shepherd's Pie which he thought was quite good. I had the Cornish Pasties which were tasty but small. We both had salads that had virtually no flavour. But the Butter Beer was awesome!
If you are a fan its an experience..If you are not a fan too expensive and food is ok not great. Staff is friendly and supportive. Place is clean.
Good quality, price was a little high, but the view from the terrace of the castle was something else!
When I go to a theme park I usually expect to be paying for atmosphere rather than quality food but in this case I was very pleasantly surprised. I ordered the chicken and ribs combo and it came with corn on the cob and roasted potatoes. It was only $15!! The chicken and ribs were very moist and tender and the sides were flavorful. I was very full afterwards. Even though it was very busy I received my food almost as soon as I ordered it. We were sat immediately and were out quickly. The atmosphere is amazing and straight from the movie. I would highly recommend this restaurant. 
We enjoyed The Three Broomsticks more than the Leaky Cauldron. The food was better and we really enjoyed the atmosphere. 
For about $20 for adults, you get a LARGE portion of chicken, ribs, corn on the cob that is grilled, and roasted potatoes. It's quick to order/get food but definitely not fast food. It was well cooked and delicious. On top of that, the atmosphere of the Three Broomsticks REALLY makes you feel like you are eating right where Harry Potter ate. Its so fun and was the highlight of our entire trip as far as restaurants (in or out of the park!). After all that pizza, burgers, and fast food, this was a perfect dinner and very reasonable compared to all the other places in the park. And for extra fun,, go to the back patio of the Three Broomsticks and look down over the railing and you'll see all kids of fish and turtles everywhere. My kids LOVED it. If there were a restaurant outside of Universal, we'd have eaten there every night after....
on the loud side, but food was good. we were seated quickly, polite staff. restaurant was clean and tables were wiped immediately
The food is good~ it is typically 'British' food, such as fish and chips. I also had an ale with a magical twist! It is reasonably priced. The best thing about it though is it's atmosphere~ it makes you feel as though you are really in harry Potter's world. They play music from the films too. The staff were friendly, upbeat and fun.
For a theme park, we thought the food here was pretty reasonably priced. You can get out pretty cheap if you buy kid meals and stick with water. The problem will be that the drinks are really good (Butterbeer and Pumpkin Juice were our favorites), are very popular with the kids, and will run up your tab a bit.
When placing our order the trainer was not helpful and actually quite rude; I presented my AAA card which is supposed to get us a 10% discount on food and merchandise at Universal and she refused to give it claiming they don't honor it anymore even though I had checked prior to arriving in Orlando. My fish and chips was not very good (I actually only ate about a third of it). The place was packed and the staff appeared to be shorthanded; the floors were not clean and they put us a table for four when our group was five. I will not return here!
We had breakfast included in our Harry Potter vacation package to Universal and this restaurant was our breakfast location in Hogsmeade. The food was average, but what you would expect at a theme park. A lot of pork, which is an issue for us, but we were able to find something to eat. The atmosphere was very, very cool. The staff, however, were very rude.
Stepping in to this restaurant one appreciates how well Universal succeeded in creating a Harry Potter experience for guests.The very large tavern had great decorative touches that kept us looking around for our whole meal. We visited at lunch, and just beat the rush. The food options include fish and chips, shephard's pie, grilled chicken, ribs, and a variety of vegetables. We (2 adults and 2 kids) opted for the family feast. At $50 it was very reasonably priced. It came with a huge garden salad served in a giant pot, 4 quarters of grilled chicken, four servings of bbq ribs, roasted potatoes, and mounds of steamed veggies. They were all served on a platter family-style. Everything was great. The salad was fresh, the grilled chicken satisfied even my little picky eater, and the veggies were steamed perfectly. There wasn't a mushy broccoli to be found.Butter beer is delicious and full of sugar, and totally adds to the Potter experience. The wait staff helpfully found us a large table in a cozy corner, and the meal was enjoyed by all.
"Ate lunch here on our day at Islands of Adventure. The food was good, as was the butterbeer. Authentic English fare, in a pay-then-get-then-sit cafeteria style restaurant. I have no problems with the food itself. My issue lies with the staff here. As a waiter for 5 years, I was trained extensively on how to behave in front of guests and what to say and what not to say. If I were a manager here, I would be appalled for what the staff got away with. When entering, the greeter made a sly comment to my girlfriend about how she could ""probably get away with eating off the kids' menu, since Daddy (meaning me) is paying for it"", with a wink. She was angered, and I was offended. The comment was made because of my receding hairline, which I am not proud of by any means, and being reminded of that actually took away from our Universal experience. I understand that it's supposed to be a more laid-back atmosphere, but it should not get to the point where staff are poking fun of customers to a point such as this. If any management staff read this, I hope you take my concern seriously. I will not be returning to The Three Broomsticks in the future, despite how good the food is here, because of this issue."
We all had the chicken and while it wasn't bad, it wasn't what I was hoping for either. The chicken was a bit dry and didn't have as much flavor as I had hoped for. As one might expect, we went at a busy time of day so we had to wait a little longer for our meal than I would have liked.The potatoes that came with the chicken were seasoned well and quite tasty. The corn on the cob was decent but just didn't have the flavor I was hoping for. Go for the experience, especially if you are a Harry Potter fan. The prices aren't bad, especially for the amount of food you get. If you have to choose one place to eat in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, skip this one and eat at The Leaky Cauldron (see review of Leaky Cauldron).
Great atmosphere, enjoyed the english tea and choices of breakfast entrees. Plenty of places for couples to sit away from the families.
My daughter and I ate here on a recent visit to Islands of Adventure. It's all about atmosphere. Very intriguing decor right out of Harry Potter. The food was average- we had cornish pasties and salad. Just ok and pricey for the quality. The high rating is all for the experience.
We liked the look and experience but the food was just average and overpriced. An unfortunate circumstance of theme park dining.
This is a lovely themed restaurant with the staff dressed in authentic Harry Potter costumes. We wanted to have breakfast here and while it says you need to book or reserve a table we walked in on the day and had no issue - it was early may 2015 so maybe it was quieter than high season. Sick of park and fast food we opted for the kids and adults continental breakfast which included fresh slices of melon, a croissant and a scone. The child menu version was just a smaller portion of the adults. We got one adult and one child portion between four of us - we had already had breakfast in our hotel so were not hungry and it was plenty. There was no problem just ordering this and we just ordered two extra drinks. The atmosphere was great and the kids spent time checking out all the displays and we never felt under pressure to leave or rush our meal. It was expensive for what we got but well worth the experience - dont be afraid to share a meal if you are on a budget. If you are having butterbeer try the cold or frozen one - the hot one is awful. Check out the talking boars head and look up when you are sitting down they have several displays overhead. It is dark and cool a great place to be when it gets too hot outside. It was also a chance to take five away from all the hustle and bustle of the park.
All of the food in a theme park is going to be expensive, so don't expect cheap food, but this was good food but the experience is what is awesome.The ribs are just ok, but the turkey leg was good.Don't leave without trying the frozen butterbear. It tastes like cream soda and butterscotch, very sweet,but delicious. 
The food is good and the place is clean. The workers are nice. It is located in a good place in the park. The atmosphere and decor are magical. It is like being in a Harry Potter movie
The Three Broomsticks provides such a good alternative to regular theme park food! The meals are 'traditional English' options, are really make you believe that you are in Hogsmeade! Try a frozen butterbeer! You won't regret it!
The food was good, we had the roasted chicken with roasted corn and the Cornish Pasties with a salad, both entrees were tasty and the portions were about average for the price. The atmosphere however, was excellent! I kept expecting to see characters from the movie walk by at any time! We would definitely eat there again if we go back.
"There were three of us so to cut costs we decided to share the ""feast"" which is actually meant for 4 people but it was close to 2 pm when we ate so we were starved. And WOW first you get a whole bowl of salad then a whole tray of food that has chicken, potatoes, broccoli and BBQ ribs, so good! Definitely get a frozen Butterbeer to wash it all down with. There were a ton of staff members to take your order and find you a table. Very well done, definitely added to the whole HP experience! It felt real and you can't beat that!"
we had breakfast one day and lunch another day at The Three Broomsticks and enjoyed the food and the décor there!
The fish and chips rival those in London. You can't leave without trying Butter Beer. The frozen version is great in the hot weather. Watch for the house elves shadows in the second floor while you are eating.
The butterbeer is the highlight of Three Broomsticks. I think there are better places to get something to eat at UOR. If I was forced to eat here, I think the best meal is the fish and chips. I never expect this to be a memorable eating experience as the food is mass produced, but it is really is a poor quality for such an exorbitant price.
Love the butterbeer. The chicken sandwich was okay. Love the fact that the servers are in character... including hats. Attention to detail very high. Very clean.
The food was okay. The price was even worse. However the experience of it all was phenomenal and only added to the greatness of the attraction.
I spent more time looking around the building than eating my breakfast, which isn't a true full English as we don't serve croissants but it was good nonetheless. 
I had stopped in Hogs Head (which is the adjacent bar) many times in my trips to Universal and the smells wafting from the Three Broomsticks always made me want to eat here. It was only when I had family in town that I waited in the larger than normal line to eat here.I was not disappointed. We all ordered different items. I had the rib and chicken combo. The ribs were very good. As mentioned in other reviews, the chicken was a bit dry (maybe that is the style they are going for. It was good but I prefer the meat to be juicier.) The potatoes and corn sides were also well prepared and it is a sizable portion. My sister had the fish and chips and the chips were excellent. She said the fish was well prepared too.You can get the Hog's Head Brew (a Scottish Export Ale made by the Florida Beer Company) or a butter beer with your meals. One thing to note, they do not serve sodas in this restaurant.
We had a reservation and when we got there they were confused about the whole reservation thing and then told us to just get in the line for general ordering. Get decor and great Harry Potter experience.
The atmosphere here is very nice. food was decent. one of the places to get butterbeer! Ribs were good, chicken was a little dry, side potatoes were very good. very spacious, so waiting time is generally low.
We had the chicken platter and the rib/chicken combo. Both came with roasted potatoes and corn. All were good. Also tried the tea/lemonade mixture which was good and refreshing. Atmosphere is great.
The food is pricey (as is all theme park food) and not fantastic (but not bad), but as far as theme park food, it compares well and the experience of the environment makes it worth it. The pancakes were actually very good, scrambled eggs were not. 
waited a long time because we wanted to experience all of the park, but should have went somewhere else. Turkey leg was dry and shepards pie was bland. 
Definitely stop in to take a picture, but the food is a little on the pricey side for what you get. If you stay at an onsite hotel, you will get a free breakfast here (as well as at the Leaky Cauldron) and you can choose any meal on the breakfast menu plus a drink. I didn't have lunch/dinner here so I can only speak for the breakfast, but it was a fun experience and exactly how I pictured it! 
The three Broomsticks is a great alternative to basic theme park food. I got the American Breakfast and it was awesome! Will return next time! Make sure you make reservations!!! 
The menu looks pretty gross (for example, Toad in the Hole is one of the dishes' names) but as someone who has actually eaten British food, I approve. They got the feel without the actual gross factor. I had the bangers and mash, my husband had the toad in the hole, and both were quite good. There's plenty of seating and the attendants inside are all friendly and helpful, as is typical of this area in Universal Orlando. I'd eat here again. Oh, and they also sell a decent selection of beers.
The Three Broomsticks is a must do when you're in Islands of Adventure! I haven't tried all of the food items here but of what I have sampled, the fish and chips are by far the best menu item. They have a thick traditional breading. If you're not particularly hungry that day, try the kids portion for the same flavor in a smaller size. I recommend staying away from the kids mac'n cheese- its straight out of a box. For those that are used to Disney, you can get a free cup of ice water at this location if you ask for it. Grab a beverage, get a plate of pub food, and enjoy the atmosphere!
This place is great for families. Our family of 5 ordered the Family Feast, which is made to feed 4, but there was so much food that we couldn't finish it! It consisted of finger licking bbq ribs, tender, juicy roast chicken, herb roasted potatoes, buttery corn on the cob, steamed veggies, and a family style salad.
I had an American breakfast here and it was great. Very tasty and gave us lots of energy to walk around the parks afterwards. A little on the pricey side, but worth the experience if you love Harry Potter as much as I do.
Fish and chips are great. Roasted chicken so-so. Plenty of seats too! Grab a frozen butterbeer over the cold one!
This was a great place to eatThe theme was greatFood was delicious The corn on the cob is hugeeeeYou will leave feeling very full
You can pretty much expect burgers, dogs and chicken fingers in most locals but here was a different story. Feast style dining ala Harry Potter. Chicken, ribs, chicken and ribs, corn on the cob and of course Butter Beer. Of course the price was a little high as my kids wanted to ribs and chicken but well worth it for the taste and speed delivered. 
"Liked - staff very friendly and helpful, food outstanding Disliked - fell in love with the ""Feast"", but since we were only 2, feed 6, made no sense to order. Stared at it every time it went by though."
Go in here and order a butterbeer instead of waiting on the insanely long line just outside. Only went to the bar but you can get not only butterbeer but a wide variety of drinks that, I imagine if imbibed on a hot day, can go far to making the whole world seem magical.
We were visiting the park over Spring Break and the restaurant that we wanted to dine at (Confisco Grille) closed at 6:00PM during the Holiday week. Very POOR on Universal's part. Lots of other patrons were being turned away at 6:10PM during Spring Break week. Seriously!So we made our way back to 3 Broom Sticks and searched for something to eat. We had chose CG because it was a sitdown table restaurant with lots of appetizers which was what we all wanted. We thought that sense 3 BS had nice patio seating that it would be a good substitute. The issue was that their menu was just not what we wanted. There were 5 of us and we ordered 3 1/2 Chicken Platters for 4 of us to share. Wife ordered a Chicken Salad. We were not able to substitute any sides on the Platters so we would up with potatoes and corn - okay. My wife's salad was pretty muchiceberg lettuce with some chicken on it. Not her cup of tea.Sadly, we tossed half of the food in the trash and spent $45 in the process. The food was just very okay and not what we really wanted. We would not return to this restaurant. It was not horrible just not our cup of tea.
We chose The Three Broomsticks because we wanted a Harry Potter dining experience, We were thoroughly pleased with our decision. We ordered the Great Feast for our group of four adults ($49.95). It included roasted corn, vegetable medley, potatoes, tossed salad, smoked chicken, and ribs. We also decided to order the infamous Butterbeer. We got our salad first and then the rest of the meal was brought to our table. We ate there twice during our visit and each day we walked away satisfied. As far as the Butterbeer it tasted like Creme Soda. I would recommend The Three Broomsticks for anyone looking for a hearty, healthy meal.
Awesome attention to detail and the food was fantastic! Make sure to take the time to look at everything as there is much to see!
Ate breakfast there, very nice. Typical breakfast food, but the drinks and atmosphere make it a highlight. You should get reservations
Having breakfast at Leaky Cauldron and Three Broomsticks was part of our Universal Orlando Harry Potter package and at $16/pp for a family of 4 these two breakfasts saved us a lot of money. As stated, I preferred the breakfast at Leaky Cauldron. Their Apple Oatmeal Flan was hands down better than the Three Broomsticks Porridge. I thought the porridge would be similar to oatmeal but it was more a soup consistency and not filling at all. Very bland and a disappointment after having had the yummy Apple Oatmeal Flan the day before at Leaky Cauldron. The other meals choices were similar to Leaky Cauldron and my family enjoyed their breakfasts and especially the cold ButterBeer it was served with. The breakfast menu when we were there:Traditional English Breakfast: Farm fresh eggs, sausage links, black pudding, English bacon, baked beans, grilled tomato, sautéed mushrooms and breakfast potatoesPorridge Breakfast: Old fashioned steamed oats with fresh fruit and butter croissantContinental Breakfast: A colorful array of fresh fruit served with croissants accompanied with assorted jamsAmerican Breakfast: Fresh scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, crisp bacon, and link sausage with butter croissantPancake Breakfast: Three fluffy buttermilk pancakes, crisp bacon and link sausage with butter croissantEating here really is more about the atmosphere and memory than the food and for that it was exceptional!
We ate here for lunch our first day at the park. We did not have to wait at all to order and get a table. There were four of us, so we decided to order The Feast for $49.99. It comes with chicken, ribs, salad, corn, potatoes, and mixed vegetables. I feel that we eat a little more than the average family and we still could not finish it all! The food was delicious--especially for what you expect in a theme park. We were so impressed that we went back our last day that the park!**They serve butter beer here. It is basically cream soda. It is very sweet and tastes like butterscotch. If you are not a fan of sweet things and over the age of 21...try Dragons Scale.
I was worried at first because all the review talked about bad food and not getting in unlass u had a reservation. Well, my son and I didnt have a long wait, got in and the food was great. The rib platter I had was very good and plentiful. My son had the turkey leg. The price wasnt bad either. Waitress/waiters find you a table so it wasnt a hassle. 
We had to eat here, since we are Potter fans. The line was confusing ( you have to go to two different places) The prices were average for a theme park and the atmosphere was fun. The fish and chips were a hit with the family and what we recommend.
We love eating there! The ribs are delicious, the fish and chips is really good too, the butterbeer is a must!
The lines may be long, but the wait really isn't. I've waited longer at a Red Lobster to sit down to dinner.The food was very good and plentiful. We ate both breakfast and lunch and both were superb! The staff and service is excellent!
Dropped by here for breakfast with the kids, no reservations but not a problem as it wasn't very crowded. I was unimpressed with the food for the price. I think the scrambled eggs were powdered, which, considering the price, is pretty scummy. The kids did get to try butterbeer and pumpkin juice, so all was temporarily right in the world. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.
"We were looking for a place to have breakfast but unfortunately we were just minutes too late so we ate an early lunch. My party of 2 adults and 2 teenagers (1 with celiac disease) ordered the ""feast"" for 49.95. It was way more than enough food for 4 people and was very tasty. We got 2 leg/thigh and 2 breast portions of chicken, 4 rib sections, corn on the cob, roasted potatoes, family sized salad, and broccoli, squash, carrots and green bean mixed vegetables. Everything was very tasty and the only down side was that the ribs are bare (no sauce). The meat was well seasoned though and tender. Best of all it was all gluten free and not cross contaminated.   The atmosphere is wonderful and very immersive of the Harry Potter theme. I would eat here again on future visits to IOA."
We loved this! The breakfast is a standard range of options, but the food was very good and we could not have asked for better atmosphere. If you get this included with your package from universal, you can sample butter beer and pumpkin juice for free which is really cool.
Food was good. They have the seating down to a science by helping seat you once you have your food. Only glitch, no soda or pop sold here. Kids liked Shepard pie/cottage pie and. chicken sandwich. My husband had the stew which was tasty but serving size was a bit skimpy as it was in a bread bowl and bowl was not hollowed out very far. I had the fish and chips. They were good. 
The five of us enjoyed our lunch. Everyone liked what they had ordered. Portion size was good, except for my fish and chips. It was a little overwhelming to know where to go, balance all the food on the trays, and maneuver to your table. Beautiful theming. 
I’m so glad we ate at 11:15am when the restaurant was still mostly empty; I’m sure it’s packed at noon. I enjoyed the soup and salad combo with split pea soup. Others had fish and chips, which I can testify was very good, since the portion was too much even for a hungry teenager. The side dish of veggies (broccoli and carrot) seemed fresh and were not overcooked.
Not surprising for a theme park the cost and food are not a good balance but the scenery and experience is worth it. A reasonable Fish and Chips but small portion of chips compared to the fish which is odd as the fish must cost more. The food was Ok but expensive for the portion size, the setting in the restaurant was excellent, the queuing system to get served dreadfully inefficient and slow. Worth it if you have the time and money.
Very good breakfast! There are several different plates to choose from. I think we have the American Breakfast, the English Breakfast & I think the kids had plates with pancakes. (I might be mixing this up with breakfast at The Leaky Cauldron which was just as good but had a few selections which varied from The Three Broomsticks) I think the thing we loved the most was Butterbeer for breakfast!!! (my husband had pumpkin juice which is also very good)
atmospheric ,very good if you are in to harry potter ,we had breakfast in there and it was very good 
I was terrified I would not be able to eat here as reviews had said you need a reservation. Nope , we got in right away !!!. I had ribs and chicken and it was AWESOME. My son loved the food also but I cannot remember what he ate. We both didn't like the food at the Leaky Cauldron.
They have healthy choices, lots of room, and an atmosphere that really made us think we were there. The menu was full of fun food and the staff was awesome. 
Fabulous decor and tasty food. Even though the queue seems long it actually moves quite fast so you're sitting down before you know it. A bit expensive for what you get but average for Universal.
Recently been to universal orlando and we don't often eat at the theme parks usually as we aren't lovers of burger & fries! So we were pleasantly surprised to find the three broomsticks offering lovely food very reasonably priced, the menu ranged from lots of different salads to cottage pie and veg, BBQ ribs with corn on the cob, fish and chips all the different variations of chicken, all in all not a pizza and burger to be found well worth a visit if you find yourself in Harry Potter World
We ate here on the first night of our Universal trip sometime after 8pm so it wasn't crowded. Food is good and the drinks are even better. Butter beer and Pumpkin juice are a must try!
We've used the restaurant twice so far for breakfast. Basically fast 'canteen' type food, but tasty and hot. Adding the fruit cup worked well for a bit of 'healthiness'.... Great venue..
The food was fine, but was impressed with how quickly the staff found us tables (as crowded as it was).
Ok so you think the food is going to be magical. ...get it? Anyway it was ok. We got the Cornish pies, turkey leg, and the fries. It was okay. If your hungry then try it but if you can get back to City Walk and eat then do it. 
"The last thing I expected when I went into the Three Broomsticks was some of the best amusement park food I have had in ages. The Sheppard's Pie (OK it was beef, not lamb, but got with it) was very, very good. The Fish and Chips were hot, crispy and fresh, and the Pasties were really good! OK, you are going to spend about $17 for a meal and drink (you can get the 'diners card"" for $20 and get another drink and snack elsewhere) but overall, I thought it a pretty good deal, and some really enjoyable food."
We are Harry Potter fans so our real reason to come here wasn't the food. It was alright. I was delighted however that they made Gluten Free Pancakes for my daughter who has Celiac. On that point, I'd give them 5+ stars.
It's incredible how efficiently the employees are able to accommodate so many people so quickly. The food was good by amusement park standards but the atmosphere is worth the visit. The details are exquisite, even down to shadow videos of characters in the background. Really worth a trip to have a Hogs Head beer and just take in the scenery.
My daughter and I shared an entree and it was plenty for the two of us. The service is managed nicely and we had our food in a timely fashion. Do have the chocolate trifle dessert.
As we were walking by the 3 broomsticks, I asked one of the greeters when the best time to eat was. He let me know that things got really busy from noon til 3, so we came back at 11:30 and had an excellent time without any wait. Thanks so much, Jack.
Portions are on the small side and cost is on the high side, but its in a theme park. The food is very good and the atmosphere is awesome.
Our family got a chicken platter with half a roasted chicken, corn on the cob and potatoes and a kid's fish and chips with fish, fries, and grapes and a frozen Butterbeer (the best drink ever -- kind of like a mild cream soda infused with butterscotch). We all shared everything. The chicken was tender. Everything was so delicious. I was full by the end. If you're going to be at the WWoHP, you need to stop here and eat. If you come during normal lunch hours (or dinner hours, I assume) then you will wait in line to get in.
Having tried several of the items, I highly recommend the turkey leg. It is so delicious. The ribs are also good (but turkey leg is better). Also, the potatoes that come with several of the dishes are awesome. I could eat an entire plate of those.And of course, get the frozen butterbeer!!Random tip: The lines for butterbeer inside here and at the Hog's Head are much faster than the lines outside. You can save time and get out of the heat if you come inside to order your drink.
The food was the best in the park. The chicken was amazing and we got patatoes and corn on the cobe. The butter beer was great. 
"My husband and I enjoyed the rustic ""meat and potatoes"" meal options, it fit the atmosphere. We both had roasted chicken, roasted potatoes and corn on the cobb. The food was so good that we went back to eat here the next day. It was a very good price and the food portions were great. Much much better than other options in the park."
We traveled during the beginning of Spring Break/Mardi Gras so it was a little busy. I do like the idea of food, pay, someone escorts you to a table. We had the ribs/chicken/corn and fish and chips. The food was above the usual grade for a theme park restaurant. Plus, Gilly Water!
Good food with a nice variety on the menu. A bit pricy($15-20) but worth it when you are tired from walking and want to site down and eat a decent meal. Really liked this place.
Had to wait in a line for about 10 minutes, but it moved surprisingly quickly.Ordered, was directed to a counter to pick up the order (within a few minutes), then we were seated with our food. Expensive for what you get, but not surprised for the park.I got the fish and chips, it was reasonably good - I've had better.My friend got the chicken, which was ok but kind of dry.Atmosphere is LOUD (again, not a surprise) but fun to look around and watch the shadows on the wall.
I ate here while in the park. My friend and I had the fish and chips It came with fries and 3 pieces of fish . They were very good. It was very cute on the inside. But very crowded. We had to wait in line for about 15 minutes. There are other sandwich options to chose from like a chicken sandwich or BBQ. Entrees can run from $12 to $14 . 
A visit to Harry Potter Park would have been incomplete without visiting the Three Broomsticks. At least that's what I had thought. I ordered fish and chips. I thought it won't go wrong. After all it's the most famous British Muggle Food, right? I was wrong. I was really disappointed with the food. This is not my first fish and chips. Sadly, it had no flavor at all.
I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food here. I was not expecting how good the food was, and also the service, event when very busy, they moved the line quickly, and did not allow people to sit at tables until they got their food making tables available for those who had food, something that isn't done in most counter service restaurants.
We were VERY excited to go here and glad we did but wouldn't rush back. The queue to the register didn't take too long but after ordering food the queue to collect it took forever. The people putting the orders together seemed to be very flustered and got ours muddled up, they didn't seem very happy either! It cost nearly $50 for two English breakfasts and a kids meal with drinks. The food was ok, not great. The theming throughout was lovely though and made up a bit for the chaos of actually getting food, sitting down etc.
ATE THERE TWICE AND WORTH EVERY PENNY! This is the only resturant that has fresh meats brought in every night at midnight for the next business day. Nothing is frozen. Nothing here to dislike! Their lunch is very filling and perfectly cooked. Atmosphere is beyond amazing! MUST TRY.
We were very excited to be able to eat here. The wait was about 20 minutes to reach a cashier & place our order, but the food was wonderful! We had the roasted chicken, roasted ears of corn & roasted red potatoes, & Gilly Water of course to drink. The food was quickly handed to us and then a server took us to a table..I recommend this place to everyone going to Universal Studios.
It could be that English food is just not our thing. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special. The idea that you're eating in the Three Broomsticks is fun though. And the frozen butterbeer is absolutely delicious.
The theming is great, but the wait to reach a cashier to order food and beverages should make anyone visiting during peak season think twice before visiting. The food is generally the same as that served at the Leaky Cauldron. You have to keep your entire party with you until you have said beverages and food in hand. You are then directed to your seating. There just has to be a better method for seating. With the Florida humidity and heat, sometimes part of your group (i.e. the more mature traveler) needs to get to a seat much more quickly than the younger members of the group. 
Don't wait before you are starving before you go because the lineup can get pretty long. The servings are small for the price, but the quality of food is good. I tried it once just to say I ate at the Three Broomsticks, but you can probably get better value for your money at City Walk or outside Universal. However, if you have to stay at Universal, this place is a good alternative.
"I love this restaurant. It's absolutely beautiful. And to be honest, it's ""Feast for For"" is one of the most delicious and affordable meals you can buy in a theme park. Don't forget to watch for the shadows of owls, broomsticks, and elves that periodically appear in the rafters, especially in the evenings. And if you're tired of butterbeer, try a pumpkin fizz (it's not as sweet as the pumpkin juice) instead!"
Great food, service and atmosphere. In the midst of the magical land of Harry Potter, this is the place to eat. Nice selection of substantial food to satisfy us muggles. Well organized to keep large numbers of people moving through the line to order and then seat you quickly. The atmosphere is excellent, well done with attention paid to detail as in the rest of the Harry Potter World.
The food is just so-so, not bad, just not the best we've ever had. Our breakfast was included with our Universal package. We had the pancake breakfast, and it was good. This is a place you need to try once while visiting the Harry Potter areas, just for the ambiance of the place! They serve you really fast, so don't let a line stop you here. 
I am a traveler with allergies and we had a sick one with us. We three adults and had breakfast there. Asked for meat to be put separately(I am allergic to pork) and ordered 2 breakfasts with an extra drink. They were hot and tasty. The fruit was fresh and sweet. The cast members were helpful and attentive even for a counter service breakfast. The two breakfasts were enough for all three of us.
Had Free Breakfast with our HP vacation package, and although it was interesting, it wasn't the most flavorful food. Very average if you ask me. 
I'm only reviewing the breakfast, I've heard lunch is better. We had a package deal that included breakfast at The Leaky Cauldron and Broomsticks. Both had the same food but Leaky is the better choice if you are forced to eat at either one. The reason is that at Broomsticks you place your order then wait in a line to fetch your food. At Leaky, you place your order and then they bring the food to the table (less standing around). Both places have great decor but they don't know how to make breakfast. At Broomsticks I got pancakes, my wife got the American breakfast. Bacon was fatty, pancakes were cold, and her eggs were not cooked properly. Each plate was $15 (a bit high for breakfast but you are in a theme park). The lunch menu looked a lot better.
We ate lunch here. Pricing and food were as expected. Food was fairly tasty and portions were adequate. What impressed me was how Universal has crowd management down. Once we finished the ordering we were met by a staff member who ascertained our seat needs and quickly located a table that would accommodate us. Then we were promptly seated where we proceeded to enjoy our meal and wonderfully themed decor! So well done!
Food was ok, could have been hotter but staff very helpful and restaurant was kept clean and tidy. Reasonable family restaurant.
We had an early lunch (10:45am). Needless to say, the restaurant was not crowded. The food was reasonable priced and tasted good. The inside of the dining area has a great deal of detail, so take your time eating and walk around and see the whole restaurant. You do not need to buy a meal in order to go inside the dining area.I only gave it 4 stars because the food wasn't anything that we would want to go back and eat again. We were glad that we went in. The value of the food served is much better than the quick service locations.
For theme park food, this was pretty good. Fish and chips, ribs, chicken salad all satisfied. I do wish they would take the time to pull off the back membrane on the ribs, which makes it harder to eat. Staff was very good at clearing tables and directing you to an open spot. Thank you for that! 
"We came to Universal with this lunch spot as a must do during our time at Universal. We had the family feast again, with frozen butterbeer. The meal and the butterbeer were as good as I remembered. The staff was efficient with seating and delivery of the main meal. My only complaint is that we asked for dressing on the side for the family sized salad and was told ""NO, it's already premixed"". So, you can't portion some salad out and some dressing on the side? I really don't think I'm the only one asking, and I don't think it's a difficult request. So, I hope management will consider this, unless our cashier was just being difficult."
The reason you go to eat here is for the Harry Potter experience and they have done a good job with that. Some unusual dishes directly from the books. 
You know you are at the right place when you see the three broomsticks. Enter what looks like a huge British tavern and be directed to a big Harry Potter animated newspaper where you can pick what you want. Place your order then move to another area to pick it up then on to pick up your condiments, etc and then you are led to a table. We've tried a number of things and shared tastes back and forth of the shepherd's pie, Cornish pasties, chicken, ribs, corn, and potatoes. They offer combo platters and a Great Feast if this is your big meal of the day. There are some good desserts available as well including a chocolate trifle. Breakfast here is good- especially the American one. The British breakfast is just gross. No matter what meal you visit for, be sure to have plenty of butterbeer. It is really delicious and we loaded up on it. It is a soda that tastes like a vanilla shortbread cookie (like an A & W cream soda) with butterscotch flavored non-dairy topping . You can get it cold or frozen- or do both! I love it in a slushie consistency.
We ate here for lunch while touring Harry Potter World. Prices were okay considering where you are. The ordering process was fast and efficient. The butterbeer was delicious, as were the fish and chips. The pasties were just okay, as was the mac n' cheese. The atmosphere was like a giant old pub.
We ate here as part of the Harry Potter package. Meal was fine but we liked the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley much better.
We were a party of 5 (plus a toddler). The service is similar to fast food, order at the counter, move to another area and collect food, drinks then to station 3 condiments, utensils etc and finally while holding trays and kids wait to be seated. We ordered the Great feast, which consists of 4 small chicken leg quarters, 4 small bbq ribs, 4 ears of corn, roasted potatoes and vegetables and a bowl of salad to serve 4 about $40/50. (The platter of hot food was brought to the table when it was ready) we also ordered a cornish pasty meal (3 very small cornish pasties and salad $8) a regular butter beer, a hot butter beer and a frozen butter beer. The food was good, not great the butter beers were a huge hit!
The atmosphere makes it worth while to eat here. Unfortunately, we got seated outside which really doesn't have the same feel. The food was fine but not great. I liked the corn on the cob and the potato and carrots. Others in our group got the fish and said it was good. The frozen Butterbeer was a hit with all of us. 
Had breakfast at Three Broomsticks when visiting Universal last week. We went to experience the Harry Potter sections of the park and this was just another part of the experience. Im glad I got to go here and eat but would not do it again at least not for breakfast. Food was pretty much just plain greasy and it was high. For my wife and I it was $30 for breakfast. The atmosphere is very much what you would expect, they did a really good job of immitating the movie. Even fed birds that were coming in for scraps while there. One problem is we had early passes to the park and they didnt open till 9. Additionally, nobody working in the park had a clue to when Three Broomsticks even opened so we stood at the door just waiting. It wouldnt hurt for them to post some hours outside.
We went there for lunch this past month while hanging out at Harry Potter World. The place is very well decorated and makes you feel like you are inside the movie while enjoying your lunch. I had the chicken with two sides and a drink for just over $20. The food was pretty good but definitely not worth $20. I would personally recommend making reservation at Mythos instead, as the food there is phenomenal and worth every penny. But make sure you make an early reservation, they are always sold out!
The atmosphere is so much fun there. The food is good! And if you like real beer, there is an actual pub in there that makes Hogshead beer. It is really good! The Butterbeer is there in The Three Broomsticks as well as a few more places scattered throughout that area. You would not want to miss that. It is nonalcoholic. 
Was fun to check out for the decor. The food was just average - but fun experience nonetheless... Service was fast even though the line was quite long. Efficiency at its best.
Food was really good. Better than I expected from theme park British food. Price was theme park appropriate, but I felt like we got a lot of food. Service was very friendly. If you're only doing one Harry Potter dining, do it at Leaky Cauldron. I found the experience a little better. Don't forget to have a butterbeer!!!
It's got great atmosphere and wonderful food. The whole restaurant is exactly like the books and movies. It's just fabulous to sit and enjoy.
We had a reserved breakfast with our vacation package. The restaurant was awesome with detail that any muggle will find neat. We went on a Tuesday at 10 am and it was not bust at all. We had typical american breakfasts and they were very acceptable. We were not disappointed. It is not cheap (in my opinion) to eat there. You can eat inside or on a patio behind the restaurant. 
Very good breakfast...they were even able to do gluten free. You order at the counter and they bring it to the table. Great selection...even had Harry Potter/British theme that did not disappoint.
not a smile to be had.. and the food took forever to get to the table.. very different experience from the day before at the three broomsticks!!!
I have been to England and had excellent full English breakfasts there every day. The runny eggs, cold beans, and cold croissant provided at The Three Broomsticks is nowhere close! However the staff is charming, the building itself is very interesting and styled accurately, and the butterbeer is fantastic.
This was a fun atmosphere to eat in . The food is good and you can dine inside or outside. The kids loved it but liked the leaky cauldron better I think because it did not feel so crowded. 
We came in for lunch around 11-11:30, got served very quickly! Good choices of english foods and great service. Quite cold though for some reason, doesn't seem to have much lighting but the decor is fascinating.
Three broomstick is a kids favorite. The butter beer is great. Real food - baked potatoes, corn, pasties.I wouldn't say it's great - but it is on the better side of any meal in any theme park I've ever been to. Oh yeah, they serve beer too.
Love the pear/apple cider and fish and chips. Hubby had chicken and enjoyed it. There is always a line here, but it moves quick and I've always found a table either inside or out back, over looking the water. 
We decided to do the $49 family dinner which is quite a bit of food. It's a full rib, four quarters of roasted chicken,tons of roasted veggies, fresh corn on the cob, a big salad bowl which is taken to your table. We have two teenagers with us and that feed my beasts just fine lol. I think the butter beers is the expensive part of our meal but water will be given if asked.
The chicken an ribs option is the best deal! is around $15 US but it will leave you full and is better tasting than a $12 US burger you can find all around the park.TIP: For $20 US you can buy the Universal Studio Dining Plan includes the Entree, 2 beverage of your choice (under $5 US) and 1 dessert of your choice (Ice Cream, Butterbeer, Pop Corn, Ect) if you are local is a great deal as it doesnt have an expiration date!
The experience, like everything in the Harry Potter portion of Universal, was great. We had breakfast for two kids, and two adults and paid over $60. My wife and I had potatoes, eggs, bacon, sausage and a croissants, with a hot drink. Kids had pancakes, croissants and bacon. Potatoes were very greasy, eggs were ok, bacon was soggy, and croissants were a little stale. Hot butterbeer was good, but almost too sweet. Hot chocolate was good. I realize we're a captive audience but the prices were very high for the amount of food. We ate elsewhere in the park for other meals and none seemed this expensive.
First, according to my 7 year old, Hot Butterbeer RULES. We are indebted to 3B for introducing us to it. Otherwise this was a rather uneventful and in some ways annoying breakfast. Our pre-paid reservation-as part of the HP vacation package-was early in the morning and we wanted to eat fast and jump on the Hogwarts Express for the opening of US's Diagon Alley at 9. But even though early park admission was 8am, a number of us stood in line at 3B for at least 15 minutes before a staff member bothered to tell us that, despite what our reservations said, the restaurant would not open until official opening at 9am. HOW ABOUT LETTING US KNOW THAT EARLIER? If you can't spare a wizard, at least post a sign so we can use our EPH better. Annoying to say the least and no apologies given. Park/reservations need to work this one out. Once you get into 3B, it is a counterservice, much like any and you carry your food and seat yourself. The theming was ok but nothing remarkable. We much preferred the theming and service at Leaky Cauldron the next day. (see that review). Pancake breakfast was ok. Coffee was atrocious. Staff seemed rather uninspired by their setting and roles, and kind of slouched around with minimal effort. Very fast food feeling to it. Will be skipping this restaurant in the future.
While my family and I had an unimpressive time at Universal Studios, is little eatery in Harry Potter land really impressed us. Nice food choice, pretty good quality overall, reasonably priced, and very efficient service! Great place to eat and enjoy the excellent job they did recreating Hogsmeade.
After queueing 30 minutes to get in we finally ordered! Shepherds pie, kids chicken and 2 chicken and rib combos. Yes it's expensive (16oz mineral water $4!!!) but what do you expect in Harry Potter world?! Food was very nice, ribs especially where great. Loved the huge corn on the cob! The beer was an acquired taste but at least we gave it a go! Would recommend
I have been to Universal twice since the opening of WWHP and both times I have enjoyed an amazing meal at The Three broomsticks!The atmosphere is obviously the main attraction, any Harry Potter fan will love eating here because like everything else in Harry Potter World the decoration and details are meticulous and it is so much fun to immerse yourself in that world.The other great thing about the Three Broomsticks is the incredibly yummy and more importantly healthy options that are so different to your average theme park fare.For breakfast the traditional English breakfast is a must! Everything about it is just amazing!!I love the Cornish Pasties the best for lunch, they are always fresh cooked and hot and taste divine. They come with a side salad, which I will admit could use a little work (often it seems a bit limp like it has been sitting there awhile) but overall its an amazing meal. Best of all its not too big which means you can enjoy a guilt free trip to Honeydukes afterward for a little dessert.Of course the best thing on offer (not just here but throughout WWHP) is the Butterbeer! I highly recommend the frozen option which is a great accompaniment to lunch and very refreshing on a hot Orlando day. It can get a little busy in the restaurant so if you can try and have an early or late breakfast/lunch to avoid the crowds. Even when it is busy though meals tend to come fairly quickly and once you can find a table you will be fine.TIP: This time around I did also lunch at The Leaky Cauldron and I will admit that I ended up preferring lunch over that side of the park. If you can go for two days and eat lunch at a different venue each day so you can compare!
For Breakfast and If staying at the Cabana Bay this is a good alternative, price close to the same as Hotel but served much hotter and pay before eating. 
You simply must try it. My friend had the roasted rotisserie chicken, mini potatoes, and corn on the cob. I had the same, but the chicken and rib combo. It was delicious. The corn was crispy and flavorful, the potatoes were tender and flavorful, the chicken was tasty and tender. The ribs practically fell off the bone. The service was definitely better at The Leaky Cauldron. Three Broomsticks must get the B string of employees, but the manager was trying hard and the cashier was friendly. The manager apologized profusely for the Leaky Cauldron employee specifically telling us that butter beer refills were discounted with the souvenir cup. That's actually not true, and only applies to regular soda. She discounted the butter beer as an exception. That was nice of her.
My cousin and I went to Universal Studios for the purpose of the Harry Potter experience and having a meal at the Three Broomsticks was a part of the trip we were looking forward to. Compared to the other restaurants we visited, both of the Harry Potter themed restaurants seemed better managed and also seemed to get people in and out in timely manner. The food was fairly decent and provided a nice break from the crowds outside. We plan to go back one day and we return to the The Three Broomsticks again. I had the English breakfast (my cousin had the American breakfast) and both were more than enough, portion wise. The drink, we had the cold butter beer, was excellent but not very large. Other than that, we enjoyed our trip to The Three Broomsticks.
"The Three Broomsticks was my granddaughter's (my favorite Harry Potter fan) choice for lunch. Being a rather new Potter fan, I wasn't sure what to expect but both the exterior and interior décor gave you the true fell for Wiszarding World. The atmosphere was great and the authentic décor was perfect. Once you enter the restaurant, you follow the line of people up and down a couple of lines until you reach the cashier. At one point you see a glass case that has sample of items on the menu as well as a large listing of the menu. You pay the cashier who gives you a number for a window that you go to get your meal(s) kinda like cafeteria style. You are assigned a waitress who takes you to a table provides serve throughout you meal. From the time we entered the restaurant until we were seated at our table was approx. 10 minutes. The food choices our party of four had were plentiful and delicious. My granddaughter had the Shepherd's pie while the rest of us had the Chicken and Ribs.....DELICIOUS all the way around. We each had a ""warm"" butterbeer. It's like a carmel flavor hot chocolate and very rich. So glad we gave it a try."
We just returned from 3 days at Universal Orlando Resort. We had one breakfast and one evening meal at the Three Broomsticks. My wife and I both thought the food was good, we liked the way they show a sample of each dish in a window where you can see what it will look like, and it does look just like the samples when you get it. Obviously, what you are paying for is the atmosphere, which we loved, but the service was outstanding, courteous, friendly and knowledgeable.
We didn't find any of the food outlets in either Universal park to be outstanding in any way. Restaurants and menus are all geared to processing as many people through in the fastest possible time. The Three Broomsticks wasn't really any different. Our grandsons got into the theme and really enjoyed just being there and having their butterbeer. If it wasn't for them, we would have given this place a pass.
My Wife and I have eaten twice at the Three Broomsticks and haven't been disappointed. The Turkey Leg was moist and wonderfully prepared. The Fries tasted delicious. My wife got the pasties and she loved them as well. Make sure you get the FROZEN Butterbeer. It is much better tasting than the cold.Overall, while a little high in price, we love this restaurant at Universal Studios and highly recommend it. It never seems to be overly busy (although we visit in Jan/Feb).
We loved the Harry Potter theme sit down restaurant. It offers different kind of drinks for the Potter enthusiast, pumpkin juice, pumpkin fizz and butter beer are all on the menu as well as family style offerings. Food was very good. The fish and chips were tasty and my sons loved the big turkey leg and the ribs. A good choice for hungry families.
I loved the building itself and all the detail that went into the restaurant. However, the staff was not very friendly and the food was just ok. 
Gave it a try. Probably wouldn't have again. Food was good. The experience of eating there was fantastic.
Free breakfast came with our hotel booking. The pancakes were good. Sausage was good, but kind of rubbery. Decor was fantastic. I guess if you like ok food but great decor, go here
"We were sold on a breakfast at the Three Broomsticks by the lovely folks at Universal Studios. ""A wonderful experience in Harry Potter themed pub in Hogsmeade. The kids will love it!!"".We prepaid for our meal and were given a 'reservation' time. Imagine my shock when we lined up, with many who had no reservation, and waited for 20 minutes to get up to the front. Then, we got to order our food at a kiosk and then stand in another line to wait for our food. Once that was received, after another 10 minute wait, we then had to dodge and weave around looking for a table. The staff were non-plussed and only when we asked where we could sit did they even give us a nod. I paid almost $90 CAD for a quick service meal of pancakes and bacon. RIDICULOUS. I was furious and still quite angered by this sales tactic by Universal. I will be calling and I will be getting a refund. Lesson: when Universal calls to sell you a reservation at one of their restaurants - do some homework before you commit. "
Three Broomsticks was awesome. We didn't eat - just got drinks and were told we couldn't have a table. At first I was bummed - but they led us to a door and you can sit out back under the shade and it was really nice out there with a view of the lagoon. ALSO don't miss the Hogs Head bar connected to the Three Broomsticks. The hogs head on the wall will wake up if he is tickled. Ask the bartender. If you have too much to drink...use the loo next door and listen for Moaning Myrtle! She is in both the women and mens room. **Note - cold butterbeer is too sweet...get it frozen or even hot. The cold was just too much. The butterbeer ice cream is awesome too over at Fortescue in Diagon Alley. 
The atmosphere was really cool, the food was basic - pancakes/eggs etc. Enjoyed a butterbeer with my breakfast which was great, but I was hoping for more of a dining experience and it was more just a fast breakfast.List a vegetarian option! Create an option for Pancakes, Eggs, and Potatoes. I had to order it custom.
Wow, my daughter is a big Harry Potter fanatic and she wanted to try this place. I figured absolutely because it's a part of her childhood experience so, we went. If I were to begin to tell you how good this place is it would be in the form of a book. However, I will share with you that the FEAST FOR 4 is a must for any family. The APPLE PIE is not your granny's apple pie because this is so good that you'll be wanting to eat the serving it came in! Fish and Chips are outstanding with no greasy mess or guilt. Service is outstanding / friendly. Everything was so good ATMOSPHER, FOOD, PRICE, and SERVICE we at there again the following weekend. It's a must try place.
Great atmosphere, especially for the kids to experience the world of Harry Potter. The food is overpriced - typical for a park. They are efficient with ordering, picking up the food and directing you to a table. Because of this process the food can be cold by the time you are seated. Perhaps everyone need to try once for the experience, but would not recommend.
The Three Broomsticks has a meal for 4 for 50 dollars. We feed 6 and still had left overs. It was very good, A basic salad but the veggies where amazing, Broccoli was cooked with a crunch, I always love red peppers and the potato's are cooked with onions. Chicken and Ribs are good as well. Three Broomsticks is attached to the Hogshead pub. Try the microbrew. Unfortunately there is no mixed drink with Butter 
Food is not good at all. Mediocre at best. Food not hot when served. Everything served on paper/plastic products. Worse then typical theme park food. 
My husband and I went to The Three Broomsticks/Hogshead for lunch on a trip to Universal. The staff member at the till was very helpful and immediately located an allergen menu when I said I couldn't eat wheat. We actually sat in the Hogshead part of the restaurant, which was quite gloomy but very atmospheric. As with most things at Wizarding World of Harry Potter, you get the most out of it if you enter into the spirit of things!The food was not bad, the portions generous and it felt quite in keeping with the theme of the place, but it is pretty much the same as you get in other bits of the park (like Jurassic Park area). I had chicken, potatoes and corn on the cob. Unless you really want to eat there for the atmosphere, I would probably say just pop in for a drink or something if you can't face the queue (which wasn't too bad when we went but the park was very quiet that day). Also, if it's not too cold, sit outside!
So if you are at Universal, you need to take the time to eat at the three broomsticks. The food realy is fantastic, and the details in the decor is out of this world. There is also a small bar to one side for those tired parents who need to relax and have a cold wizards brew ( an excellent stout brewed in Orlando) they have several other great brews and drinks as well. And of course you should not leave without having a butter beer! The frozen ones are awsome!!
If you're a Harry Pottter fan this is a great place to enjoy a beer. I ordered a hogs head brew and sat outside where there was a great view of the Hogwarts castle! The inside looks great too. I didn't order food as it did look very expensive unfortunately.
We entered the Three Broomsticks during the time when they were changing over to lunch. We wanted breakfast--no problem! They were so accommodating and took our breakfast orders straight away. The staff here should be commended. I observed their cheerful can-do attitudes during my one hour visit and was quite impressed with them. We had the egg/bacon/sausage/ potato/croissant, and the boys had the pancake/bacon/sausage/croissant selection. All our food was tasty.
We had breakfast. They asked if we had reservations, but we didn't. They let us in anyway. I'm guessing it can get pretty busy in here.
This place is big, which is good since the line can be long! It moves at a steady pace, though, and you get a decent amount of food for the price. We sat on the Hog's Head side of the dining area, right by the fireplace. That was fun, a little bird kept flying in and out of the cauldron there, the kids loved it :)Moaning Myrtle talks in the restrooms right outside, I thought that was a fun touch :)
We had breakfast and lunch here and liked the food very much. Since this is a restaurant inside an amusement park it gets five stars, if it wasn't it would get a three. Don't forget to get a butterbeer, they are delicious (butterbeer definitely gets 5 stars).
The restaurant was big and noisy, and everything was throwaway, like many places in Disney - plastic plates and cutlery etc.. We're use to recycling everything in Canada, so it felt like a lot of waste. But eh food was tasty. I had the meat pies, nice, and salad, which tasted crisp and fresh, and then trifle for desert, which had real fruit and dark chocolate in it.
This place is done well. They are busy but have a good system for ordering and paying that keeps things moving. The feel is very authentic, like everything in all of the Harry Potter areas. The food was also very good. From the basic fish and chips my kids tried, to my Sheppard's Pie. They have many hearty English items, that are a nice break from normal park food and they have some simpler items for picky kids. I would highly recommend trying both the pumpkin juice and butter beer. So fun and good. 
Chicken very dry. Meal was overpriced. My children loved eating in Harry potter world. They loved the butter beer
You may have to wait a short while to get your food. Staff are friendly and food was really good and not too overpriced. I got the chicken platter which I was told was gluten free, had roasted chicken with potatoes and corn on the cob. There was plenty of seating and outdoor seating is also available. The Hogs Head is available at the back if you want alcoholic beverages, one drink per ID is the typical rule here.
We had lunch at the Broomsticks I had the roasted chicken and my husband had the fish and chips. We really enjoyed the meal. The roasted chicken came with potatoes and corn on the cob so it was filling. It wasn't crowded when we went so there was no wait. The place is big too so you don't feel crammed in. If you get a chance stop in for some grub or a butterbeer.
We had lunch at the Three Broomsticks. I had the fish and chips and my husband had the pasties with salad. Out of the meals that we ate at the Universal parks, The Three Broomsticks was the best. The fish was good quality, it was crispy and not too heavily breaded, and my wedge fries were hot and fresh cut. The theming in The Three Broomstick and the Hogs Head is amazing;the head of the hog behind the bar in the Hogs Head snorts and moves every few minutes. No Aberforth or goats though; probably a good thing.
I knew that while in Islands of Adventure we were going to eat here for lunch. The line wasn't to long but we waited and the service was very friendly. We ordered the Great Feast and the Frozen Butterbeer. We were seated and given our drinks. They brought out our salad to eat while we waited. It didn't take long and the rest of the meal was out. The waitress that tended to us was so nice and kind. She helped with making it a true Harry Potter experience. The feast included half rotisserie chickens, spareribs, corn on the cob and potatoes and broccoli. There was enough for us four. We had a little left over but it was so delicious. The chicken was moist and not dried and ribs were the way we liked them. The potatoes were great and so were the vegetables. The frozen butterbeer was just delicious. I preferred it over the other kind. If you get a chance to stop and eat here I would highly recommend. The building itself it a great thing to check out and view. It is of course decorated within the Harry Potter theme.
Good ribs and turkey legs. The ribs were served with tiny roasted potatoes! Yum. Realy fueled us up! 
"Food was ok, the seating situation was suboptimal as we had to wait in line after getting our food to be seated; and this was around 1:30pm. Its one of those places we tried just because its ""the three broomsticks"" in Harry Potter land..."
My family of four loved this restaurant. There was a long line outside of the restaurant but it moved pretty quickly. It took us about 25 minutes to order and be seated but then the food came within 5 minutes. We ordered The Great Feast. The menu says its a meal for 4 but it can very easily feed up to 6 people. The portions and big and delicious..it includes 4 quater chickens, 4 portions of ribs, salad, veggies and potatoes. The theme in the restaurant is really cool. Very Harry Potter like. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're visiting Universal Studios.
Out of our two trips to Universal, this was the best value/food experience. I got the Cornish pasties and also a warm butter beer. My wife got the shepherds pie. Universal just doesn't seem to be able to do the food thing as good as Disney. But the theming was excellent.
This is always one of the highlights of a visit to Islands of Adventure. I had fish and chips and my companions had the chicken/ribs platters. Lots of good, hot tasty food.We love the pear cider, pumpkin juice and butterbeer!Universal does it right...good food, great atmosphere.
The Great Feast was delicious and provided a lot of food for a family. Fish and chips were also good. The atmosphere is good. Their system is a little chaotic, but we got our food and were well fed. 
Highly recommend the family platter for 4 people $45. More than enough food for a family of 4-6 people. Plenty fo veggies from a garden salad to steamed veggies and corn along with chicken a ribs. Helathier option and well worth the value.
The menu here is a lot less odd for the picky eater and less expensive than the Leaky Cauldron. This meal was a life experience for the kids and they LOVED it. We had the Fish and Chips and Shepherds Pie. The food was very good. Also we tried Butterbeer (Delicious), Pumpkin Fizz (more Delicious) and Cider (Delicious). I really wish I could have gone into the Hogs Breath for a brew. It was a magical experience!
We were originally going to come here for breakfast but were delayed as the Gringotts bank ride broke down.In this place you order your food at the till and then collect your food from the counter - the place was really quiet also so we found our own place to sit. Hubby did not fancy anything off the main menu so he ordered double mac and cheese and chips from the kids menu, I ordered Cornish pasties and. Salad ( the healthiest meal of the holiday)Food was good and great value but we enjoyed the food more at the leaky cauldron earlier on in the holiday.
We are a family of 6 and all vote a 5 rating. The breakfast was fabulous! The atmosphere was perfect and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Try pumpkin juice and the pear cider was just sweet enough! 
We bought the $50 feast for 4. The food was actually quite delicious and abundant. The place was well managed and nice for a fast food in a theme park. Highly recommended.
This replica of the Three Broomsticks from Hogsmeade in the books is a charming, accurate replica and serves pretty good pub fare to boot. There is a lovely back patio area to eat on in good weather and a separate bar area if that is your only goal. Given the quality of theme park food, this one was above average for sure!
Loved the atmosphere! Loved the food! Everything completely evoked the ambience of the pub from the Harry Potter books and films. The staff was friendly, but a few folks behind the counter made it pretty clear that they weren't happy to be there. Still, loved it.
We needed to find a place for breakfast. Three broomsticks is one of the rare places that serves it in Hogsmeade. The breakfast food was typical of a greasy spoon, but the atmosphere was fun. We discovered that there is an amazing back porch to eat on that overlooks the water. It was absolutely lovely and relaxing. I noticed that the lunch menu had some nice looking options, but we ate somewhere else so I can't comment on that quality. They did have a family special that included salads, sides and entrees for about $49 for a family of four.
"Recently my family and I went on vacation to Disney World and Universal Studios in Orlando, Fla. While at Universal, as my daughter is a ""Harry Potter"" fanatic, she insisted we eat at The Three Broomsticks within the Islands of Adventure portion of the Wizardly World of Harry Potter. Frankly I was not looking forward to eating at still yet another over priced, sub par quality food establishment, but put on a brave face so as to not ruin the pure joy and excitement for my kid. What I found was a really cleverly designed restaurant, that could have been straight out of the movie, with very decent food at not horrible prices. Both my daughter and my wife had the Cornish Pasties which came with a side salad at $8.99 and I had the 1/2 chicken platter, with corn on the cob and roasted potatoes for $10.99. The chicken was fall off the bone tender and tasty, which frankly shocked me! Compared to several other places we ate at both Disney and Universal, this was in my estimation, the best quality food, and a really enjoyable experience. If you have little ""Hogwarts"" in your brood, they'll love this place!"
I was so excited about being in Hogsmead, I had to have lunch at the Three Broomsticks. And what a meal! Delicious, rich, unforgettable!
"Three Broomsticks is a great place for muffles to grab food while visiting Universal Studios.Ordering/Picking up food: Once you get up to the register to order it's fine. But there is a cluster of lines that make getting through to the seating challenging.Seating: don't worry about finding a seat, you will get one. Staff will direct you to a table. We had 8 folks in our party and were easily seated.Food: Ordered ""The Great Feast"" for 4 folks. Worth every penny! 4 sets of ribs, 4 pieces of chicken, broccoli, potatoes and 4 ears of corn. Could feed 4-6 adults."
I am gluten free and they have a gluten free chicken sandwich with a GF bun and fries! The atmosphere is very cool and things are responsibly priced. 
We had fish and chips - it was ok. Some of the meat meals looked good and had great accompaniments, but these weren't available unless eating meat. The pumpkin drink was very sweet and the butter beer was like an ice cream soda which had been whisked.
The setting is like being in the movie. Truly spectacular, at least stop In and look around even if you don't eat. The food, however leaves a lot oil be desired. We ate there for breakfast and it was OK, better then our prior experience for lunch. They do help you find seating which is nice.
We had shepherd's pie and a butterbeer, which was good, but we cannot comment on the other offerings. But what was really amazing was just sitting in the eating area and taking it all in. If you prefer outdoor dining, there is a patio just to the back of the building where you can eat in the shadows of Hogwarts. Appropriate for kids of all ages. Wander to the adjacent Hog's Head for a beer after dinner...
Greeter gave us a great tip on what he and his wife order. Spot on! Line appeared long and I was hungry and wanted to leave, but I was persuaded to stay. Good thing! Line moved quickly and was well organized. My order was taken, we moved to the pick up location and then was efficiently seated by staff members. The decor is fantastic and clean! I worried that I ordered ribs and that I would leave hungry. Not so. Lots of meat on the bone and it fell away with just a fork. I prefer more bbq sauce and that was readily offered. Corn was terrific, not soggy at all. Roasted potatoes were fresh, hot and a huge portion. Perfect meal.
If you go here to lunch, let me tell you it's not for the food but for how the place is decorated. Very nice ambient, just like Harry Potter's pub. The butter beer is not as delicious as you see it in the movies, but it's drinkable.
As huge Harry Potter fans, we were looking forward to eating here so much. We went for breakfast and were served by an unwelcoming surly older gentleman with a bad attitude, no patience and who didn't hide his annoyance when we asked about a children's menu. There isn't one, by the way. We had to buy a full priced adult breakfast at $12.99 for our 20 month old son. After being at Disney for 10 days and finding a child's menu everywhere (including Mickey Check Healthy meals) we were sorely disappointed. After paying for the most expensive breakfast EVER, we received our 'only okay' breakfasts that were a little on the small potion side. Still, it suited our baby who ate his pancakes and enjoyed them. What saves this place is not the staff, nor the food and certainly not the ridiculous prices - but the setting. And it has been done SO well! Just as I imagined it from the books, it has atmosphere, authenticity and it was easy to imagine this is just what JK Rowling envisaged. The Pumpkin juice is good, the American breakfast okay......but you are paying for the experience and not a lot else. You might be better off just stopping in for a Butterbeer and soaking up the surroundings. Staff need to be more polite to paying customers. A smile wouldn't go amiss either!
Stopping in to eat here as a non-Harry Potter fan (sorry) and really enjoyed the experience. A queue to order and pick up the food at the same number at a different counter. It is also nice that you don't have to search for a place to sit.....they will seat you. I ordered the fish and chips-they were okay. Nothing spectacular, but it was good. I also had the warm butterbeer (seasonal)....now that was delicious!!!Overall, it was fun to have the HP experience.
If you are familiar with 'toad in a hole', fishermans pie or ploughmans lunch, then you will enjoy eating here. All well done and excellent surroundings. The butter beer did not disappoint! Staff like elsewhere, were courteous and friendly. We had a great time and enjoyed our experience. I'm not a big fan of theme park food, but this was worth it!
Me and my friend went in to dine here whilst we were at Harry Potter world. We didn't have to wait long. The small queue moved very fast. You make your order at the cash registers and then move on to the collection point. You then move on to be seated. I didn't want to be told where to sit, so we just walked straight on. We found a great seat right next to a window in a private little nook. I had ordered the Cornish Pasties and Graden Salad. The pasties were very light and crisp. I am from the UK, and I have eaten Cornish pasties in Cornwall. So you can imagine how surprised I was to find out these were just as tasty, if not better! The salad was very fresh. My friend chose the Fish and Chips and she said they tasted really good. We both washed our food down with frozen Butter beers. I was absolutely addicted to this drink, it is so refreshing. The decor of the place is amazing, so much detail. The staff are all dressed in Hogswarts clothes etc, which really adds to the atmosphere. Even if you aren't a Harry Potter fan, you cannot fail to be impressed! We had a brilliant time.
The whole Harry Potter experience was so much fun,and the Turkey Legs are way better here then anywhere in the Disney Parks...reasonably priced and the atmosphere looked like the movie. It was great and we went back a couple times.
I am an addict. On a three day trip to Universal, we went here each day. Butterbeer and turkey legs. That's life. The food is a bit pricey but, similar to all other places in the park. The turkey legs are huge and can easily feed two people(when I'm willing to share) and the butterbeer. Oh my goodness I am in love with it. When arriving back home I immediately tried to find a recipe for it. Really good place to eat and the HP decor made me love it even more.
Fantastic ambience, and British style food. Enjoyed our breakfast here more than our lunch (the chicken was rather tasteless). Don't miss the hot butter beer!
Went to the Three Broomsticks when visiting Harry Potter world. The food was TERRIBLE. I took two bites and threw it out. Save your money - go in, take a picture, then leave and eat somewhere good. Or go next door to Honeydukes and buy some fun candy!
We love Harry Potter and decided to go to the Three Broomsticks for T-Day. We love the food here, huge turkey legs, fall off the bone spare ribs- all served with roasted potatoes and corn. Can sub in salad or add for a small fee. All of this, plus you get to dine in Hogsmeade and drink Butterbeer and Pumpkin Juice!
The food was better than expected for a high-volume theme park food. There were good options for kids and adults. The flow of the restaurant allows you to order, get your food and then get a seat assisted by staff throughout. It helps you not have to fight for a seat once you get your food. It wasn't cheap but nothing at the theme park is, and this was a reasonably complete meal with a number of traditional English options.
Nothing great for breakfast. We had a reservation but it didn't matter as it was a reservation with about 100 people. It was crowded and they had large tables saved for groups that I never saw. The decor was obviously great, very potteresque. 
Best deal in the park, feeds four adults and the food is delicious!! We couldn't eat everything. Family style, starts with a generous bowl of tossed salad and beverage of your choice. You are escorted to a table (no hunting for a table). The remainder of your meal is brought out with perfect timing. Just as we finished the salad, the tray of food was delivered. Four 1/4 chicken, four slabs of 2 ribs, four ears of roasted corn on the cob and a heaping pile of roaster broccoli, carrots, onions and potatoes. All were cooked and seasoned perfectly, and so much we couldn't eat it all. The restaurant is so beautiful to look around and see all of the cool Harry Potter theming. Staff was all very courteous. The restaurant was clean and kept tidy. It was very busy when we were there, and it ran like a well-oiled machine. Definitely the deal of a meal for the $ and portions. Highly recommend and a must when we return in the spring!!
I was already like a little kid when I walked into Hogsmeade. We were hungry so we parked it in here. I had the Cornish pasties (which tasted like pot pie) with a butter beer (not frozen). My food was delicious! I loved the ambience. It was almost as though I stepped right into a Harry Potter book. Now if only we can make butter beer a permanent thing that I can buy anywhere I'll be a very happy girl!
Loved it in here, didn't try the Butterbeer though. Like all theme park restaurants a little pricey, but good fun.
Everything here was great! It far exceeded our theme park restaurant expectations! I had the fish and chips twice while we visited! I loved it! 
"Breakfast at The Three Broomsticks was part of our Universal package. I wish we'd eaten at the hotel. The scrambled eggs were pre-made and almost cold. The bacon wasn't crisp (also clearly pre-made), coffee was weak. I'd suggest people not include this in your package. Once inside, you could be anywhere..... nothing ""Wizarding"" about it."
My stepdaughter took a crowd of us for our birthdays. We ate at the restaurant she works at, The Three Broomsticks. It was fantastic! My wife had the fish and chips, I had the shepherd's pie, and she bought a great feast for her and the other four in our party. I tasted the fish and chips, and polished off what five ravenous teens left of the great feast, as well as my shepherd's pie. There wasn't a single item that was sub-par. Everything was excellent, although you will need to season to taste if it is too mild for you. Otherwise, I would recommend The Three Broomsticks to anyone visiting Islands of Adventure!
It's perfect for the Kids (and old kids…). Pancakes, Butter Beer, american brakfast, teas, in an awesome place that feels like a Harry Potter's restaurante.
We go to The Three Broomsticks for our lunch. The food is really good. The detail and atmosphere is authentic Harry Potter. Whether you sit inside or outside with a wonderful view. We decide for the Fest, we was 5 adults and 2 children and de amount of the food was ok. We will come back again.
The decor of the three broomsticks is the only real reason to dine here. The food is okay.. There are many other places in the park that have better food. The service is pretty fast. Be ready to search for a table during peak times, luckily the employees help you find tables.
The theming really elevates this place. Without it, the food here would be average at best. We enjoyed our meal. It wasn't anything particularly special but it was edible and we were hungry. We tried both the regular and the frozen butterbeer. The kids liked the frozen better; we liked the regular better. the frozen one seemed sweeter. We wouldn't hesitate to eat here again but we wouldn't go out of our way either.
Feels like you are really in the Harry Potter books/movies! The food is quite good and the Butter Beer is awesome!
We had breakfast here$15.99 each, a little expensive but you are in a theme park so expected really. They do better value meals for lunch and dinner, e.g Fish & Chips $6.99. We waited until later in the morning to miss the rush but quite efficient anyway.
Let's face it. If you're eating here it's because your a Harry Potter fan, not because you are expecting a fine-dining experience. The atmosphere is amazing, and the food is good. Some items are better than others. For breakfast, skip the English breakfast as the blood pudding is not good (and I lived in the UK for a time and like black pudding.) Here it tastes strongly of cloves.Fish and chips were very good for lunch. Butterbeer was amazing but very sweet - skip dessert if you are having one.I think the menu is a little better here than at The Leaky Cauldron. They also have fizzy pumpkin juice in addition to regular.
If you are a Harry Potter fan, you have got to eat at the Three Broomsticks! The food is very good. The restaurant is not only unique in its design (it really looks like The Three Broomsticks in the movie) but ordering is unique. You stand in line and order at one of the many registers, then you pick up your food from a nearby station and take it to your table. Servers are standing just outside the food area to direct you to a table large enough for your party. The food is very good, but if you order the Great Feast, be sure that you're hungry! The restaurant says that it serves 4 people, but I would say 3...it's definitely too much for 2 people! This is the place to get butterbeer or pumpkin juice. The drinks taste much better from inside the Three Broomsticks or the Hog's Head Pub (which is connected to the Three Broomsticks) than they do from the carts outside! Like most theme park food, it's a little pricey, but the atmosphere makes it worth it!
We ate here for lunch. It was better than average for theme-park restaurants. Good décor matching the movies. We had the platter & it easily fed two adults and three kids. The chicken & ribs were good, but the grilled vegetables were very good!
Now that Diagon Alley and the Leaky Cauldron is open, you’re probably going to find that the queue over at Three Broom Sticks is a little shorter. And here’s a secret: The menus are pretty close to being the same.Themeing is true to the wizarding world, so expect utilitarian tables and chairs like what you see in the movies (or the historical record, for non-muggles). At least this place has more in the way of chairs with backs than the Leaky Cauldron. As with that other place, most of the food items are at a price point that makes the Quick Service meal plan worth considering. Plus, you can use the snack credit for a must-have frozen butterbeer and the drink credit for a sports drink later in the day.We both elected for the chicken and rib plate, which doesn’t exactly fit with the theme, but I guess you have to sell something besides bangers and mash. The ribs turned out to be a real gamble for a reason I didn’t consider: Because you’re getting tray service, you’re getting assembly line food. That means food out of bins. That means ribs that have been sectioned into 3’s. That means you could get ribs with a lot of meat, or ribs that are mostly bone, depending on how the sections were cut apart. Guess which ones I got? The pub items would have been a better choice, but at least the corn on the cob was the real-deal.I elected for a Pumpkin Fizz with my meal, which I later regretted. It’s sort of a spiced carbonated drink of weirdness. Unfortunately, they don’t actually serve muggle soft drinks – which is strange because they serve salads with muggle salad dressing. I guess they can only take the theme so far. Don’t get me wrong – lots of people like Pumpkin Fizz – but if you’re tired of the fall assault of pumpkin spice beers, lattes, shampoos, etc, then maybe go for a cider or lemonade.
"I was offered breakfast at the Three Broomsticks as part of a Universal package; since to point of the trip was to allow Grandma to visit Harry Potter, I went for it! To be fair, the greeter tried to steer me toward the pancakes (""Pancakes are our specialty,"") but I wanted to avoid some of the carbs. Oh Well.First of all, it is a rather expensive cafeteria. Adult breakfast $15 per person. Several fixed menu options are available. We opted for the American Breakfast - bacon and eggs. Eggs are served one way -- scrambled, dry (not a problem for me -- that's the way I like them) however, I am convinced that these eggs did not come from a chicken (or any other extant winged creature) -- Possibly reconstituted powdered? The ""crisp bacon"" wasn't, even allowing for poetic license, and the butter croissant was cold and dry. The whole lot was slapped on to foam plates at a pickup window with less care than my dimly remembered college dining center. Plastic cutlery and little packets of salt, pepper and condiments are available at a self-serve bar I didn't remember from either the books or the movies! An employee was kind enough to get milk for my tea when I asked for it -- I didn't see cream or milk anywhere. (I thought Universal was trying to be ""green"" -- how do foam plates and plastic cutlery fit in?) The staff were pleasant. The architecture is spectacular. I'd recommend ducking you head inside and looking around and dining elsewhere. Even Grandma was disappointed...."
If you are a Potterhead, this place is for you. If you aren't, the food is pretty decent. The three in my party had the roasted chicken, fish and chips and shepherd's pie. All were good. We enjoyed the cold (rather than frozen) butter beer the most.
This counter service restaurant is located in Hogsmeade (Harry Potter) in Islands of Adventure. It's worth eating there at least once just for the feeling of being inside the books, or films. The detailing is fun to look at, the service was fine and the restaurant was nice and clean.We enjoyed our food here. We had lunch consisting of the Ribs platter and Cod and chips. Both were generous portions and were decent quality. You can eat inside or outside with a view of Hogwart's Castle, which was very pleasant on a sunny day.
Interesting theming, but really just a glorified fast food joint, better food is available in the park.
Food was good. We appreciated that they had food allergy binders detailing safe meals, unsafe meals, and those that may have cross contamination.
We've been to Islands of Adventure a few times, and it seems we gravitate to Three Broomsticks each time. The detail and atmosphere is authentic Harry Potter. Whether you sit inside or outside (wonderful views) you'll feel part of that world. Prices are high, but food is good. The attached tavern is very small, but great - you get a real feel for the theme. There are two distinct problems, though - first, the lines to order are crazy long. They need more ordering/cash register positions. Second, they make you wait until you have your food before they'll sit you at a table. That's plain crazy, and rude, actually - they make it so that an entire family is in line, instead of only one or two people in line (all the rest should be at a table taking a load off there hectic day). And, it horrible to be stuck in line with crying squalling HUNGRY kids. We found that most sit-down restaurants in both parks use this ridiculous method. Not cool.
Great place for lunch...food was good,waiting in line---not so muchThe whole decor & look of the restaurant is truly authentic
So, on our regular pilgrimage from Alberta in Canada to Orlando, we stopped here, yet again.This is not the first time that we have gone to Universal's Islands of Adventure. We are both Harry Potter fans, and always have to see what else they have added to the park. We've stopped here each time since it opened, and it has been really good. I enjoyed the Shepard's Pie with Salad. It's important to get those greens in to keep your energy up while travelling the parks.Seems pretty cheap as far as food that is at a theme park.Butter beer is a must for any fan who also likes the idea of a butterscotch soda.Mmmm.*sigh* now I am going to have to fly back again.
Tray food, nothing is really cooked to order. Fun atmosphere but the food is not to my taste. But the kids love it and a must for Harry Potter fans. Eat here only once. 
This place is much better than the Leaky Cauldron, located in the Daigon Ally side. Great food and huge portions of it. I had the chicken and it was half a roasted chicken. It was moist and succulent, better than most I've had at non-theme park establishments. The corn and potatoes were both great too. I saw the comments about the expense. This restaurant is covered on the dining card plan, so that might be a more cost-effective way to eat here. The atmosphere is also great - just like the movie. I will definitely eat here if I go to universal again. 
We love Three Broomsticks. The food is really good - especially for theme park food. This time we tried The Feast, for four. We were not disappointed. Plenty of food to go around. Ribs, chicken, roasted corn, salad (with enough for seconds) roasted potatoes, carrots, broccoli, onions and peppers. The atmosphere is wonderful. It's on our must stop here list.
We went here for an early lunch after riding the Hogwarts Express over. It was a lot of fun. They have a line style where you order your food and then they usher you to a table. The inside of this place blows me away. There is a ton to look at and so much character on the inside. The food is a bit expensive but for what you get it is pretty good. The drinks are really what ends up raising the price extensively. It's how they get you. But you get large portions and the food I thought was good quality. The potato wedges were delicious. I always try the butterbeer but it is honestly just too sweet for me. I even like candy and sweet things but it is always just a little too much. The lemonade was delicious though. Get that instead. And honestly, for being in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter it isn't terrible price. It is the experience and being able to say you ate at the Three Broomsticks. :-)
Food was good...expensive as usual at a theme park. The best part was the atmosphere...great for all you fellow Harry Potter fans out there.
We've eaten here twice in 2 years and it is consistent and decent food for an amusement park. Fish and Chips, Roasted Chicken and the Turkey Leg are all good. One butterbeer is enough for the entire table, one sip per person is enough of this overly sweet drink. Love that they have staff find you a table when you get your food. 
You almost might believe you've traveled to Hogs Mead in this place. We were there for breakfast and the staff was VERY helpful. The food didn't quite match up to the price, but you don't go there for the food. The atmosphere was unbelievable. You keep expecting Hagrid or the Hogswarts students to come in and sit down. The kids just loved it. If you want to be Dad of the Year and your kids are into HP, this is the place to take them.
three meals of chicken and ribs, roast potatoes and corn and one kids meal of fish and chips, 4 lemonades - $70!!!!!!!Kids meal was one measly bit of fish. Other meals - awful. Chicken had to slathered in tomato sauce to cover up a strange taste. Ribs were ok, but barely ok. Ate them as we were starving. Asked the server if they had sprite, was told abruptly nope only the flat lemonade and what's on the board. 
Great place to sit and enjoy the atmosphere. Outside eating area as well. The staff are great at keeping the place moving. The is nothing special but I did like the Shepards pie
We ate here on our first day at universal. We had the chicken and corn. It was decent and the butter beer was too sweet. The environment was awesome! The staff does a great job keeping the traffic rolling through.
They even have malt vinegar, a requirement for fish and chips as we all know. Buy the daily quick service plan, it is a better deal. Can also sit outside in back to get away from the crowds.
This was by far our favorite theme park dining spot at Universal. We had the rotisserie chicken and the ribs, both of which come with roasted corn on the cob and roasted potatoes and onions. Everything was very good and a decent value. We ate there several times last week when it was not too crowded. 
American breakfast portions were good but not worh the price charged. I dont think I would eat here again, but we tried it for the experience.
Visited here middle of August so crowd level was very high but the speed of service was great. we ordered our food (fish and chips for 2 adults and 3 children) and collected it from the counter pretty much straight away. You are then seated by one of the staff. We had a large table next to the hogsmeade bar area with plenty of room for our family. Food was simply awful, fish was so greasy and had no taste and the chips were very average. Real shame because the atmosphere was great! if you want beautiful British fish and chips then you should visit the Rose and Crown in Epcot. We ordered from the take away counter and then sat at tables round the back overlooking the lake. Food here was delicious.
Decorations were ok, but nothing special. Food was pretty poor. I got to taste almost all the dishes because non of my 4 children ate much of what they ordered.Cornish Paties were greasy and bad. and the shepard's pie was only marginally better. Ribs were poor, but the roast chicken was ok,Corn on the cob was terrible: Old, overcooked / dried out and cold.Salad was poor but edible.Service was good (for counter service). They respond to complaints by generously giving you more food.The hit of the meal was the Chocolate Triffle. No great in my opinion, but my kids loved them. I suspect that they were very hungry because they did not eat much of their main courses. :)
We were so hungry and happened to walk past this place. Saw the prices affordable and decided to have our lunch here. I had a half roast chicken and my brother had a combo mix of ribs and chicken. The roast chicken came with maize and potatoes and the food is decent. On the other hand, my brother complained about the ribs because it was really dry. The butter beer was nice. On the whole, we didnt have expectations and the food was ok. Dining experience was fine.I saw many people couldnt finish the turkey leg, not sure if its too huge or not tasty but i felt the roast chicken was not too bad given that we are pretty picky with food quality.
Our smallest family member wanted breakfast whilst in IOA so we had an unscheduled stop here!Shared a couple of breakfast platters- the american breakfast with the pancake filled a hole nicely.Theming is great, in line with Harry Potter theme. Restaurant noisy and busy but great for a quick stop off.
We shared a Ploughman's Platter and it was fresh and tasty. It's advertised as enough for two to share; and while it's a bit small to be a full meal for two, it contaning lots of fresh fruit, veggies, and cheeses so at least I know I had something worth eating!But enough about the food; you came here for the ambience and the experience and, on those, this place completely delivers. It offers that dark, brooding ambience that you'd expect from a Harry Potter film and this look and feel permeates throughout. It has a main dining hall-like area as well as many dark, low-ceiling places in the shadows to eat as well.Everywhere you look, you'll feel like you are a part of the story. Enjoy!
I love this place. It was surprising to me the first time that the food is so good here. Most theme places charge a lot for the look of a place. The Three Broomsticks has food that tastes great, reasonable prices (not cheap, but they are large portions), vegetarian option, kids meals and a FANTASTIC ambiance. You can sit in the cool air, enjoy the music and look around at so many things. Make sure you check the sounds of the house elves in the corner of the Hogshead attached to the Three Broomsticks over by the stairs.
"We weren't expecting anything 1st class about the food here, since we have read the reviews. The food was ""okay"" - nothing special - although the desserts were quite good. Loved the ambiance - and since THAT was why we went in the first place, it did not disappoint! The staff was friendly, not much of a wait - and a VERY good system in place. (no saving of tables, etc. - you are seated by the staff) I will go again just for the Harry Potter experience."
"We recently spent a few days at Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. Rather than spend a hefty sum for typical fast food we opted, instead, for a full meal. There happened to be four of us, all adults, which was perfect for ordering the ""Great Feast"" which is a meal designed for 4 adults. First, we received a large salad to divide. On a large tray/cookie sheet, the server then delivered chicken, ribs, mixed vegetables, and corn on the cob. We could barely finish the meal. Price was $49.99, I believe. Drinks were not included.Service was above average. Would return again on a future trip to Orlando."
More than happy with our visit to Three Broomsticks. It was pricey, but it was real food (ribs, fish and chips, roasted corn) and I felt it was prices accordingly for a theme park. Staff was friendly and I love that they have people to seat you so no one is wandering around hoping for a table. Very smart and efficient. We'll take this, with its spot-on theming, over greasy burgers in a food court any day!
If you're a Potter fan, then you should come in for a bite to eat! The staff was friendly and very organized. The line moved quickly and there were some interesting choices. I've been in England and it was typical fare on their menu. The food was hot and tasty. It added to the excitement and experience of visiting Hogsmeade and all the rides and shops at Universal.
It's just like stepping into the movie! Traditional English food in the Harry Potter world. Don't forget the Butterbeer! And the Hog's Head is attached, so you can slide on up to the bar and have a pint while you're there.
As part of our package at Universal's Hard Rock Hotel, we made breakfast reservations for both Potter restaurants. (The Leaky Cauldron, and this one). We arrived at our 9:30 AM time, and were greeted at the door by a pleasant woman, who showed us sample plates of the available breakfasts, behind a window. My GF and I ordered 2 different types of breakfast, showed our reservation vouchers, and waited for our meals to be brought out. We were the only people in line waiting. Our food came out within 5 minutes, and we found seats. Both her meal, and my meal were cold to the touch. The scrambled eggs are obviously prepared well in advance of being ordered, and sit, getting cold, waiting for someone to order them. The coffee was also barely room temperature. I would HIGHLY recommend the buffet breakfast at the Hard Rock Hotel. For the same cost, you get made to order eggs, as well as an enormous selection of sides, and can eat all that you want. Go to Three Broomsticks, only to look around, but don't spend your hard earned dollars here. You will be sorely disappointed.
What do you need after avery early start at the theme parks a good breakfast to keep you going for the rest of the day. The English Breakfast looked like it would fit the bill but what was delivered failed on several counts. The first meal was returned as some items were cold. Second meal slightly better, but beans and black pudding both lacking any flavour with bacon underdone and greasy rather than crisp. On the whole a very disappointing start to the day. Not expecting five stars from a theme park cafe but this just didnt have any magic.
The second we walked in we ordered and got our food within 10 minutes. The food was very good and stayed true to the harry potter theme, it was very fun. Also, I suggest coming here to the bar to get your butter beer it is quicker service than the carts outside. The staff was very helpful and stayed true to their characters it is fun for all ages. The only reason I wouldn't give it five stars is because it is very loud in the restaurant and the tables are very close together. 
What a great value meal! Of all the restaurants on the island this one was the best! We had corn on cob, sheppards pie, grilled chicken, bread, apple pie and a drink for one great price!
There is no escape for a family of 5 at Islands of Adventure: every damn time you eat, you will get SLAUGHTERED on the bill. And everywhere else in the park, you will get slaughtered for a pathetically small serving of fast food disguised as something different. At least here the price gouging was for real meat, real potatoes, corn on the cob, etc. Hope you're proud of yourself, Universal senior management. Nothing like attracting families from across the globe and then advantageously raking them over the coals on food daily with nowhere to turn. Even if you try to have a fast food burger and fries in this park, you're looking at $12.99 for a hot-tray warmed beef patty. So do yourself a favor and take the family here so you'll at least get real food.
Food was ok. Not great, not bad. It was expensive, but so is the rest of the park. It is a counter service meal. For 5 people we paid $100 for just meals and drinks, no desserts, but that was everywhere, really. 2 adults and 3 children ( 17, 14, 10 years old).
We had fish and chips, it was very good, but I spent $50 for two of us to eat. The butterbeer was too sweet for mee, but it was ok and unique. They don't serve soda in WWoHP, but the lemonade was very good. Its a cool place to eat for the novelty, but I wouldn't do it again.
Upon arrival, we asked if there was a restroom available and was told be an abrupt and rude worker that the only bathroom was blocks away (was actually next door) and we should go now because if you sit without food the manager would kick you out. So I decided to NOT go and order my food first. So you order your food and then go to another line to wait for it. My daughter had the American breakfast, I had the pancakes, and so on and so forth. ..everything was cold...microwaved and plain terrible. Its beyond me how anyone would ever go back. Not worth the money and not worth the wait!
When my husband and I visited Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure, we were excited to try lunch at the Three Broomsticks. We each ordered the shepherd's pie and he had the butterbeer. I was severely disappointed in the quality of the food, which was expensive and a little cold. Since the place was slammed, not much could be done. I make this dish a lot at home, so I was walking in knowing it couldn't be as good as home cooked, but the flavor was severely lacking and the potatoes tasted grainy. The butterbeer was too sweet for my husband (words I never thought I would say) but after a few sips, I became addicted. I may try this one again if only because I just read the Harry Potter books for the first time (after this trip) and am planning another visit to see the world from a fan's eyes. For someone who wasn't caught up in the Harry Potter hype at the time, I would say eat somewhere else. 
We had a reservation for the Three Broomsticks and we ordered before waiting ten minutes to be served. Restaurant is impeccably themed and it really feels like you are in the Harry Potter books. Food was average, similar to the food served in the Leaky Cauldron but slightly better here. Butterbeer was again the highlight of the meal. We ate here as part of our package from AAA and it was altogether a fun dining experience simply for the realistic theming.
We ate a late lunch at the Three Broomsticks in Hogsmead at Universal Studios Island of Adventure during our stay in early August. While you're not going to find value pricing at any of Universal's restaurants, this one was by far the best we tried for the quality of the food, overall value, and the decor.We had a minimal wait (5 minutes) to order & pay, then were directed to a numbered spot at a counter to get our salad and drinks. We were given a numbered card to display on our table, as they bring the rest out to you. Despite it being about 3:00 pm, it was still crowded for indoor seating, so we had to wait several more minutes for our table. (There was no wait for outdoor seating, but it was 95 & humid out, so we wanted the air conditioning.)We got the Family Platter for $50, which comes with a large salad to share, four chicken quarters, four sections of ribs, four ears of corn, and a heaping pile of community vegetables to share. The veggies included carrots, potatoes, broccoli, and peppers. When you add if the drinks we got (2 butterbeers, one soda, and one Hogshead Ale), our total was about $75. We got a 10% discount on everything but alcoholic beverages with our AAA card.The salad was good and portioned to serve 5-6, not 4. The chicken was tender and juicy, very tasty. The ribs sections were 2 ribs joined. The sauce appeared to have been applied early on and allowed to dry, so it wsan't really messy eating. It was a sweet sauce and good, but not award winning. the ribs were tender and the meat nearly fell of the bones. The corn and veggies were cooked perfectly and were delicious.The interior of the restaurant is decorated to resembles the inn from the movie and is done well, although we didn't really look around at any of the smaller decorations. The section we sat in was high-ceilinged and airy.I'm glad we ate there, and would recommend it, especially compared to some of the other restaurants inside the parks.
As part of our vacation package from AAA, we received vouchers for a free breakfast here. My son chose the pancake breakfast, which consisted of three pancakes, two slices of bacon, a croissant, and a beverage. My husband opted for the traditional American breakfast, which included scrambled eggs, bacon, roasted potatoes, a croissant, and a beverage. I had the continental American breakfast, which included plenty of watermelon, pineapple, cantaloupe, honeydew, a scone, a croissant, and a beverage. You can choose from coffee, milk, pumpkin juice, apple juice, or butter beer. The butter beer is not listed, but you can request it, which I would have done had I known better. But I wouldn't come here for the food since the fruit was pretty dry and bland, and the hot food wasn't all that hot. The real draw here is the ambiance because you feel like you've been plopped down in the middle of Harry Potter's world here.
Cost over $100 for 6 small breakfasts presented on plastic plates and half of the meals had items missing. Some Staff were very rude when this was ponied out to them however when we spoke to the manager about this this was dealt with very professionally. The decor is fantastic and worth the visit but food very poor for the price paid.
For a self-confessed Harry Potter junkie, to visit the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and the Three Broomsticks is like a dream come true!. Not to mention that we get to drink Butterbeer and Pumpkin Juice just like the students of Hogwarts. So yes, even if it costs a bit more, I will definitely visit again if I have the chance. You should too... :)http://discoverbooktravel.blogspot.com/2014/07/three-broomsticks-islands-of-adventures.html
If you wanna eat here, make a reservation! The bar, however, is always open. Once you order, bar patrons are encouraged to sit on the outside patio. It's a nice deck that overlooks a waterway and Hogwarts is quite visible from there as well. There are wooden tables & benches (like at Hogwarts) to sit at under umbrellas. I had a regular Butterbeer there, not frozen. I'm told frozen is better but didn't dare have another. You can REALLY taste that butterscotch! They also have beer and other alcohol. A nice atmosphere and authentic looking interior.
Not to happy with my experience at this restaurant. Food, fish and chips good, Shepards pie small with lots of potaotes on top, all in all not bad, average food. You go up to three women who take you order and tell you about the food, then you go get the food on a tray and then a server seats you. We were seated in a corner near the back door. While eating our food it started to rain. And since there is no cover there people poured into the restaurant, causing a line. One of my party decided to go see how bad the rains were and got up from the table, while I was still eating. Suddenly she removed his tray, all the while we were telling her we weren't finished yet, she kept saying that's okay, and placed a reserve sign on the table while we were still seated and showed the person our table and then they put their tray of food down, while I was still sitting there. I got upset and left only to find there is no place outside to stand in the rain.......
"We had the ""Family Platter"" for $49 for Four people. The Platter consisted of 4 half racks of ribs, 4 roasted Chicken Breasts, 4 roasted ears of corn, Plenty of cooked Carrots and Roasted Potatoes + an Olive Garden style bowl of salad. It was more food than two adults and two 13-year-old boys could eat and was healthier than what you typically eat in a theme park. Butter Beer was enjoyed, but the Pumpkin Fizz was even better. Essentially, a drinkable pumpkin pie. We ate a little late (7:00 pm) and the restaurant was half full and we were not rushed. Bonus--If you use your AMEX card, you receive a 10% discount. There is also seating outside, along the ""river"", that is a quieter option at night."
Food wasn't great. Had the roasted chicken and it was undercooked. Wasn't happy. The butterbeer was great though.
Being the HP fans that we are, the kids insisted we eat here. I'm not going to say much about the price. You eat at an amusement park, it's going to be overpriced so not really shocked there, but the food was not that impressive. Since we were on a budget but wanting to eat amusement park food, my daughter and I split a plate and my sons did the same. My husband got a plate to himself. Between the five of us, we tried the ribs, the chicken, the roast potatoes, corn on the cob, the cornish pastries, and a salad. We drank sweet tea (or what was supposed to be sweet tea) and ordered one butterbeer to split since they're $4 bucks each and it seems silly to spend more on it until you know you'll like it. We weren't impressed with flavors. The butterbeer was good, I especially liked the foam. If we go back to Islands of Adventure, we will find somewhere else to eat in the park.
It was a hot and busy day at Universal when we ate at The Three Broomsticks, and yet service was quick, efficient, and pleasant. You order at a counter then a wait person helps you find seating. (I like that so much as opposed to people camping out saving seats and you wandering around with your trays.) The food was pretty good. I had the pasties and my husband had the shepard's pie. We both had butter beer (tasted like cream soda/butterscotch/caramel...mine was frozen...sooo good.) What I really enjoyed was looking at all the decor inside the restaurant. There are huge ceilings with wooden beams that go up, up, up. There are antlers on the walls. Everything in Harry Potter World is done with such attention to detail, it is amazing. Very happy we ate here.
The food was cold, the feeling you get is that they want you to eat fast and leave. Loud and crowded, and not much to see inside that has to do with Harry Potter. Don't bother just look inside and go eat somewhere with real food.
Everything was great. Prepaid for the breakfast at 8:30am. Food was wonderful. The whole village was awesome. Rita was a very happy employee who made us feel special. Rita seemed to really love her job. Mde me wish I worked there also.
"Had a fantastic time on the Harry Potter ride and very hungry after not eating all morning and decided to visit the Hogs Head pub. Saw food was being served in The Three Broomsticks and were happy to see traditional British dishes being served. After living in the USA for over 5 years the thought of a Cornish pasty or Shepherds pie was very inviting so we ordered one of each. NEVER GO THERE, if you are British neither resembled either. My husband and I both say it is the worst food we have ever ordered. It cost $40.00 for 2 meals, a side of fries and 3 soft drinks. The pasties that were supposed to be flaky pastry, were the size and shape of ravioli, the so called ""flaky pastry"" was like a savory"
We loved eating here, among the witches and wizards of Hogsmeade. The butter beer was awesome. I preferred the regular to the frozen, but to each their own.
The line moved quickly with an efficent seating process. The Turkey leg was OK, very meaty but a little dru. The Ribs were fantastic. Try the Pumkin Juice,..better than it sounds. Comfortable atomosphere with good AC. My favorite eating spot in Universal.
After visiting many times the parks we usually end having a burguer or pizza for lunch, we are a family of 5 and this place offer the Grand Fest for about $50, it comes with a big bowl of salad and 5 pcs of chicken and 5 pcs of ribs plus corn in the cob roasted potatoes and sauted veggies, it was a lot of giod food for the price, keep in mind that a plain burguer at the parks are around $10 each, we prefer better quality food for the same price, besides it's Harry Potter you can go wrong! The only bad thing about this place they do not serve soda drinks and everything they do have for drinks it' overpriced, we avoid this bringing our souvenir cups from past trips and get 99 cents coke refill before entering to the wizardry world (there is no soda anywhere sold here) it takes work but next to pay lire $4 for a tiny bottle of water x 5 , with some plannig you will not have problems Remenber it's way better than a burguer or pizza for a meal, you will spend the same but will get plenty of good food 
"""Please Respect The Spell Limits"" is the sign that greets you when you enter Hogsmeade the home of The Three Broomsticks. The breakfast was a good way to start the day and most certainly a wonderful way to introduce our 13 year old to the park. She was entranced from the moment we entered and we were tickled to see her that way, so even if the food was terrible, which it wasn't, we would have still enjoyed the restaurant which could be a movie double for the original. Hats off to the staff and the park for helping all of the Harry Potter movie fans live the movie!"
Food: We ordered the Grand Feast. For $50 plus tax, we had a lot of yummy food - corn, veggies, potatoes, chicken, ribs, large bowl of salad etc. Everything was delish! More than enough food for a family of 4 (including an always hungry teen). The Pumpkin Fizz is soooooooo good...I much preferred this to the Butter Beer. Do try it, especially if you like pumpkin and apple flavors.Decor: The ambiance is awesome, it's worth going to this place just for the decor. If you're a Potter fan, you'll enjoy it. Despite being busy, it was clean and inviting.We went around 11.30 am for lunch, and did not have to wait more than a few minutes to place our order at the counter. They give you your drinks right away and they brought our food to our table fairly quickly.I have to say that the host standing outside the restaurant was so friendly, welcoming and nice! Made the experience so much more enjoyable.I would definitely go back. We had a great time.
Was so excited to be in Hogsmeade - much less have lunch there - that anything would have been acceptable! Given that they have to be set up to quickly serve massive amounts of people at a time, expecting much other than edible is setting yourself up to be disappointed. I expected little and therefore I was satisfied. Expect overpriced theme park food. However, we were able to order just sides which were less expensive (still expensive, just less) and matched our needs. The wait staff was friendly and helpful. You order at a counter and then carry your own food to your table. Sort of a large cafeteria - but there were people around to help you if needed. They cleared the tables quickly when people left, making way for more hungry visitors. I loved just being there - and had it not been so hot outside, sitting outside looked like an option as well.
We just got back from our month long Orlando vacation and I just want to put a word out there for my fellow handicapped people. Don’t get me wrong because my family and I truly had a wonderful time during our vacation in Orlando. I’m a handicapped person due to a severe bilateral osteoarthritis on my knees and because of mobility issues, I require to use a scooter around. I can walk a little bit with the aid of a cane but cannot stand for a very long time. Here goes the reasons why I find The Three Broomsticks at Universal Studios not handicapped friendly. First, you cannot bring in your mobility scooter inside the restaurant. Second, you have to stand in line and wait for the server at the front to let you in. It so happened that once we reached the entrance, there was a couple that stood in front of us waiting for their party and no one informed us that we have to turn left and get into another line to order the food. And people behind us who knew about this process just went along and decided to cut in front of us without letting us know that we should just make the left turn and follow the next line. Third, was my nightmare – after we placed our order and my knees were about to give up on me, I told my husband that I would find a table to sit down. Right pass the servers standing by the tables, no one informed me that I have to have the tray of food that I ordered before I can sit down on the table. One particular server named Christine came to the table where my daughter and I were sitting. She looked annoyed and started to question “Did you get in line? Did you order your food?” I said “Yes and my husband is just waiting for it, he will be here any moment.” Then Christine said “Didn’t you know that these tables are only for people with trays of food on their hands and you cannot sit here without your food?” I said “No, no one told us that we need to have the tray of food that we ordered and I just need to sit down a bit because of my knees” and Christine said “Well this is our guest policy here, if this table is still available when your husband gets here with the tray of food, you may sit down here.” My daughter and I just left and decided to wait for my husband. A black lady server by the cashier saw me limping my way back offered a chair next to her and offered me a glass of water. My bad is that I did not make any scene and put Christine in her place. Why? Because she is young and has a lot of things to learn and unfortunately lacks proper training. Plus I am an immigrant here in the US and for the past 32 years that I have been living here, I learned how to brush off discrimination because of my skin. But now that I am handicapped and having mobility issues due to osteoarthritis, I think that I should start learning on how to make a scene and embarrass the person who discriminates me due to my disabilities. But thank God to TripAdvisor.com that I can write reviews where the world can see what, when, where and how places and their employees can make room for improvement.
"We were here in January, 2013 and had a great meal so we wanted to go back and try it again. It is still a fantastic place to grab lunch. Both times we had the ""Family Feast"". There is easily enough food for four people. Chicken, ribs, 4 ears of corn, large salad, roasted potatoes and steamed vegetables. Everything was seasoned very well, much better than ""fast food fare"". All for $50. Good price considering the typical food prices at the theme parks."
For a family of 6 this was a DEFINATELY A BUDGET FRIENDLY PLACE! Get the FEAST! It's $50 but there is SO MUCH FOOD. We ended up taking a box to go. The ribs were juicy the chicken seasoned perfectly and the bowl of salad was more then enough along with all the other veggies on the tray with the meat. DEFINATELY a meal fit for a family.
What is not to love about the three broomsticks? You are apart of the harry potter story. The decorating is gorgeous. I don't want to leave when I'm done eating. The portions are plenty, I get the Sheppard pie with a salad, its almost too much food (a great thing). Its simple, and satisfying. The Cornish pasties are bland. The chicken is moist, with a good light flavor, barely seasoned so I like to eat it with ranch. The butter beer is everything to me, its better cold, not frozen. 
First, the atmosphere is fun so be sure to take time to look around. Service was quite good. The people processed our visit very efficiently and with a smile by all. The breakfast was pretty good and a reasonable value for theme park fair. We each got something a bit different so we could share. The potatoes were super good. Eggs not so tasty. Croissant, pancakes, bacon, sausage, etc. were all pretty good. Butterbear was not a hit but we did all try it. A bit too sweet for us.I would eat here again.
The food isn't amazing but if you're a Harry Potter fan this restaurant is very well done and you must eat here. You can also get butter beer and pumpkin juice here. 
Three years ago we had a wonderful English breakfast here. This time, although it was only 10:15, they were no longer serving breakfast. We had undercooked fish and chips not on par with Captain D's for $40. Been there, done that twice, don't need to go bacl
If you or your children are Harry potter fans this is a must theme park resteraunt to eat at. These resteraunts are all very similar in the theme parks. Sort of fast food resteraunts in a way really. Very busy. Choose your food, which wasn't too bad actually, pay then u get herded to a table which is being cleaned from previous eaters. I had ribs and wife had chicken. Would go back. Expensive but to be expected, part of the experiance of universal
There were 7 of us and we all agreed that everything was ok. Had a butter beer and fish & chips for $20. Nothing special, but the closest place to eat in HP. 
Mostly come here for the atmosphere. You can get a rib plate or a chicken plate. (they have a few other choices) we had the dinning plan and wanted to eat here. 
The food is good and the butterbeer even better!The themed diner is AWSOME! I came back almost every day.Not only to just eat or drink, but also for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
I'm a huge HP fan so of course, we had to eat here and get some butterbeer. The restaurant was fun with the servers in costume, and the HP setting. The food was pretty good, the butterbeer was yummy, and I fit right in with my fellow HP nerds :)
The decor and overall atmosphere of The Three Broomsticks is amazing as you feel like you are really there, however the food wasn't that great. Being english we expected the breakfast to be better but it was greasy and tasted like it had been sat there for hours! The butterbeer is nice though, frozen is my favourite!
My husband and two teen daughters decided to eat here for lunch during our day at Universal. My 14 year old is a huge HP fan so we thought this would be a good choice. There was a short line to get in and once in...mass confusion. This is not an easy place to navigate or order from. It was also very dark and not really very HP. It was not air conditioned and while ordering it was so hot and uncomfortable. The food was ok. We ordered the Grand Feast and butter beer. We also ordered the potato soup and fruit cup for our vegetarian daughter. The ribs, roasted potatoes and other veggies were very good. The roasted corn on the cob was tasteless. The girls shared the fruit and said it was good. The salad was pretty good. The chicken legs were dry. My daughter hated the potato soup and couldn't eat it. My husband who will eat anything said the soup was awful. It looked like instant mashed potato soup with not a single actual piece of potato. We chose to eat outside on the deck as it was cooler out there and not crowded at all. Our lunch bill was nearly $85. We were very disappointed. We definitely would not eat here again.
The food and atmosphere is awesome! If you are a Harry Potter fan you will fit right in! What we like is that you can order platters and eat family style which is a nice change up from other places in the park. 
We had breakfast here on 4/21/14 while visiting Universal. This place is located near the Harry Potter exhibit and we made it a point to get up early and be here by 8am and were told this was a character breakfast for the kids but to our surprise no such luck. The breakfast here was nothing special and I would not return. It is okay but nothing special and overpriced. While the theme and atmosphere of this place is real nice you can’t eat it therefore I can’t recommend.
Great experience - we didn't have to wait at all. The restaurant is excellently themed and a very enjoyable place to eat and rest. The food we had was tasty and on the better quality side of theme-park food. I had the BBQ rotisserie chicken and BBQ ribs with corn on the cob and roasted potatoes. The ribs were the only thing I wouldn't eat again. Chicken was very good as were the veggies. My wife had the fish and chips - also very tasty and better quality than a Captain D's, etc. *See my review on the Wizarding World of Harry Potter for comments on the Universal Dining plan (in short, if you plan on eating a meal and getting a butter beer at some point, it's a good deal). 
We initially planned to eat lunch here as the breakfast reviews weren't very good, but we got a late start at our hotel so we missed breakfast. The kids wanted to try this place out so we came on in. Everyone had the pancake breakfast except me and I got the breakfast with potatoes, sausage, and bacon. My meal was good, but a little greasy. The pancakes were barely edible. My daughter loves pancakes and even commented that she could barely eat them. They had to drench them in syrup. We also tried the butterbeers and the kiddos didn't really finish them, but I thought they were good. Overall it was a very expensive meal and I would have skipped it had I known how blah the food would be.
The ambience is terrific but the wait was long. I also did not like that you could not trade out potatoes for a salad with the pasty meal. We had the pasties, the turkey leg, and chicken. They were all good.
We went to Orlando at the busiest time of the year, our experience everywhere but especially at The Three Broomsticks is, if you want to go when it isn't heaving avoid meal times. We went at 3pm and there was no queue. After eating we were able to have a look round as it was not bursting at the seams with other people. The food is alright (it will fill you up and keep you going on your day round the park) but not great, the interior however - like the rest of the Harry Potter section is very well done. Look upwards when eating to see various recognizable shadows as they move around near the ceiling (and make sure you head through to the Hogs Head part to have a look at the interior there). In truth I was perhaps expecting more as I had heard so much about how great it was prior to going, this may be due to the fact that I have gone into lots of old English pubs over the years (and it is modeled to a great extent on that type of building - which of course makes sense) I suspect if you haven't been in lots of old English pubs that the effect is more dramatic. It is definitely worth going to if you are big Harry Potter fans like we are.
I just love coming here. The food is great, especially the dinner menu. We had corn, potatoes, chicken, etc. Excellent platter and of course, Butterbeer. Breakfast selections are pretty much standard. Highly recommend for a nice break during your visit to Islands of Adventure.
All the detail that has gone into the Wizarding World of HP is amazing - they definitely did not skimp on Three Broomsticks. The food I ate was - alright but I'd rather eat here than any other restaurant in Universal. I will say DO NOT EAT AT HOGSHEAD. The food isn't that good. I got the fish and chips which were cold, soggy and tasteless by the time I got seated. I can't really complain since I was extremely tired and hungry. I'm not sure if it was because we went during the low season or if it was because it was rainy. Get the butterbeer. Just do yourself a favor and get it. If you get the souvenir mug you can 'refill' it for the price of the plastic throw away cup. I did get a chance to try Hogshead Brew and I loved it! It was definitely a delicious beer and it came with a different mug. honestly there probably is not a better option in Universal to eat but for the experience and price - I definitely thought they could have done better with the food.
I am so wary of theme park food that even though I wanted The Three Broomsticks to be fantastic, I had my hesitations. However, after our second day of using early admission to the Wizarding World I had a husband who was pretty peckish and getting a bit grumpy, and here was the Three Broomsticks ready made for a quick breakfast. We went in a quiet week between the Easter and Summer crowds so the restaurant was not too busy and we were able to go in and order breakfast right away. The pricing is fixed so all options are right around $14.99 and include a drink. Hubby ordered the pancake breakfast which included 3 super fluffy pancakes, bacon, sausage, and a croissant. The fact that he practically licked the plate clean could be attributed to the fact that even though it's a kind of modified cafeteria style the food is still really good, and also he was really, really hungry. I ordered the American Breakfast which was scrambled eggs, a large portion of home fries/potatoes, bacon, sausage, and a croissant. Everything had great flavor, and if I had any criticism at all it's the the eggs were a little dry and over-done, but, again, cafeteria style.The interior of the restaurant is a fantastic complement to the rest of the Wizarding World as you really do feel transported to this amazing world. The staff is all super friendly and helpful, and even offered to take a picture of us together. The back porch of the restaurant features one of the best views of Hogwarts Castle that can be found in the whole park, and we enjoyed popping back there after our food to take some photos. All in all we were very pleased and plan on returning for lunch on our next visit!
I had planned to eat here from the moment I planned my florida vacation, and it was definitely worth the wait, so much so that I ate here on my visit the following day.Fish and Chips was a hearty portion and really tasty and not too greasy, the chicken and ribs platter was equally as good but a lot larger.Our party was divided on the taste of the butterbeer, I certainly enjoyed it for what it was and the novelty of it all, but probably wouldn't choose to drink on a daily basis as its extremely sweet. My friend detested it and gave me her cup... personal choice, I do suppose. As its quite deer (isn't everything?) I would recommend starting with one cup, sharing it and going from there.The theming of this restaurant is just divine - Potter fans will not be disappointed, it is like stepping into the movies.
I must say that the actual building itself was very nice and pleasing. However the queuing was long. Mum questioned one of the staff if they had a gluten free menu, but they didn't seem to understand what it was, but the other staff member that was there got a basic allergy information sheet. In the end we decide to go for the chicken and ribs platter for 4. Mum swapped her ribs that came under foods not to eat because it had gluten in it. The ribs tasted a bit dry like they had just been keeping them warm, they were edible though. The whole meal in itself was very cheap and overall a nice place to eat to get in the spirit of Harry Potter.
This was a really cool restaurant. But, don't get the Sheppards pie, it was horrible. They make it was ground beef with little taste. The turkey leg on the other hand was great. Luckily my boyfriend got full and shared his with me. Got in and out pretty quickly. 
We stayed at one of the Universal resorts and literally came over to eat at Three Broomsticks multiple times throughout our stay because the kids liked it so much! They at mac and cheese with applesauce and grapes and really enjoyed it. My favorite was the pasties and salad with a frozen butterbeer, YUM!! Like I said, we went about 4 times for lunch and never had to wait in line more than 5 minutes (even during spring break). It probably helped that we ate lunch fairly early, by 11:30am.
Although I mentioned The Three Broomsticks in my review of Islands of Adventure, I believe it merits its own review. We were a four-generation group, definitely ready to sit and relax after a full day when we stopped for dinner. Of course we started with butter beer and pumpkin juice, which were both delightful, but we were truly surprised at the quality of the food and the reasonableness of the prices, especially of the children's menu. Can't wait to visit again!
You get your food within 11 minutes of sitting down. Place is awesome in itself, but the food was incredible. We had the Great Feast and it is exactly that, salad, whole chicken, ribs, potatoes and onions and steamed vegetables!! Food was excellent and we fed three adults and one child and still left half a chicken. It was a dining experience and almost could see the floating candles overhead like in the movies! Even if you aren't a Harry Potter fan the value and quality is a must have. Know where I will be dining in Universal from now on.
"After a half day of non stop walking and rides this was a great spot to stop and sit. Very busy and noisy but we didn't care because we were all starving! Once we placed our order they brought us to a table where we enjoyed a drink waiting for our meal to arrive. We ordered what was called ""the feast"" for 4 people. It was $49.99 and worth every penny!! Plenty of food for the four of us and you will not be disappointed."
We had 2 adults, 2 13 yr old boys. The feast was fun, delicious and filling. Everything was tender and tasty. It was pretty cold outside, so the food cooled off fast, but it was still very good. The boys loved the Butter beer. 
Felt like I was apart of the movie in this restaurant, felt so magical and enchanting, such a fantasy! Frozen butter beer is a must if you're going to eat here, it tastes like a frozed cream soda. The pumpkin juice, eh, not so much, I will definitely pass on it next time, others like it though. Me and the family all had fish and chips. This is not a full service dining restaurant though, you have to walk up to the counter to order your food and then go to another counter to collect it. No free refills unfortunately because we all wanted more butter beer, but had to go back to the counter and reorder again. The cons for this restaurant was that I felt they needed more of a variety to choose from on the menus. There were only a few things to order and that was it. But otherwise, it was delicous and we will eat here again when we return!
"I've been here twice for lunch, and both times hit the spot. The food is yummy, filling, and at a reasonable price. My personal favorite is the cornish pasties! The line moves efficiently, and the staff is helpful when finding a table. ""Magical"" projections make it look like owls are swooping overhead among other things. Definitely a must-do for Harry Potter fans! There's a pretty good view of Hogwarts from the outdoor seating area (learned this tip from the staff). Got some good pictures without being surrounded by mobs of people! ."
I truly felt transported into the world of Harry Potter when we entered this restaurant. The decor and everything was just so well done. We even missed the lunch rush (ate around 2pm) and didn't have to wait in line or anything! The food was really good and the staff were very helpful and well organized. Great spot.
Queuing for lunch here is like a ride in itself! The line snakes forward steadily and you have to time it carefully as it gets so busy! Good place to stop for lunch as portions are healthy and prices reasonably moderate. Salads good and chicken platters tasty. Worth a visit!
Although it's at the back of the park it's worth finding. The setup is kind of like a cafeteria, you place your order and pay at one place and then wait in line to pick up your food. There is a neat out door seating area which is a nice place to get away. For breakfast we had pancakes, and they were reasonable for a place like this. For dinner we had the shepards pie (a little small) and the cornish pasties (also a little small) the Pumpkin Juice is like apple juice with pumpkin pie spice and the Butter beer is like very creamy cream soda.
We are big Harry Potter Fans and was pleasantly surprised. We had Butter Beer, Frozen Butter Beer, pumpkin Juice Pumpkin Fizz and Fish and Chips. The Fish and Chips were some of the best i have ever had anywhere. Yes it was expensive but not more than anywhere else at Universal and the quality of food seemed better than average for a theme park.
yum!!!!! Felt like I was in the Harry Potter movies :) DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE BUTTERBEER!! I had the cornish pasties, my Dad had the fish and chips. both delicious. 
We ate here in 2011 when everything was still pretty new and was NOT impressed!! Dry, stale food with no taste, so we were hesitant to try again, but the reviews said to go. So we gave it a shot. Boy are we glad we did! I had the chicken, which was seriously half a chicken, and my husband had the ribs and chicken combo plate which had like 4 ribs and 1/4 chicken. Both meals came with a whole corn on the cob, that had been barbequed and buttered. It was delicious! We also both got the Hog's Head brew, which was a GREAT beer!! We both really enjoyed the taste, and would love to have a few in storage to bring out for company :). The frozen butterbeer is a must, even if it is only cream soda with butterscotch flavoring. Best lunch of the trip! We loved it!!!
I love to eat here, I always get the fish and chips, big fan of the frozen Butterbeer, seems to have a better flavor. Eating inside you can see and hear the occupants of the Broomsticks, house elfs and others. If you watch the walls up stairs, you will see their shadows as they walk around up there. Outside on the patio is a great view of the castle. Either way this is always a must treat for me.
We ordered the feast for 4 people and found it very delicious. The service where we ordered was quick and efficient as were the people that sat us at a table. The salad to start was very large and a good begining to the meal. The chef then delivered the platter to our table - what a site! 4 portions of ribs and two quarter chickens and 2 chicken breasts along with 4 corn on the cob, potatoes, and veggies (brocolli, carrots and red peppers). It was a feast! Ribs were quite good - fall of the bone, the corn was hot and good, the chicken was very tasty with a good seasoning and the veggies were excellent - nice to have some veggies to balance the meal. Husband and I had a Hogs Head beer (which I would recommend) and kids had butterbeers. We were all very satisified and the atmosphere of course added to the whole experience. Would definately recommend.
we had fish and chips of course and chocolate berry trifle for dessert.the Univeral studio meal plan was very convenient. Atmosphere wqs wonderful!
We had a party of 5 with 3 of them being young kids. It was over a 100 dollars for our fish and chips and one had the drumstick meal. Too spendy for what you get. Do try the butter beers though as they were delicious.
It was during our visit to islands of Adventure that we had a Breakfast meal at this restaurant. We were badly disappointed with the food. Everything was sort of bland, overcooked, and expensive. Nothing better than any other fast food restaurant,Our idea was to be at the park early in the morning and enjoy the Harry potter attractions, We thought we could enjoy something of a theme breakfast at the three broomsticks. It was noting like that, the service was indifferent, the food was barely acceptable, the theme decorations are nothing to enjoy or talk about it. But we must say that the man outside inviting possible customer was somewhat amusing.We would not recommend this place at all. The only advantage it has is the location just outside the Harry Potter rides.We did enjoy far better breakfast meals in Orlando at prices not much different from those at this place.
Although I am a massive Harry Potter fan, I was a bit septic towards this restaurant. I still really wanted to try it out. The queue seemed really long, but it went by really fast. The staff was very well organised. I was not expecting much from an american fast food serving british cliché food in a Harry Potter setting but I am very happy to say I was pleasantly surprised! The salad was fresh with plenty of dressing to accompany it (you can dose it yourself), the cornish pasty were nice and warm. The Butterbeer was superb (I do love sugary stuff though, so it is not for everyone!) The setting is exquisite with all the attention to details. A must for Harry Potter fan, even the casual fan, as the food is good. I would visit again.
It was unseasonably cold and wet in Orlando due to storms up north and we wanted to get out of the rain and eat breakfast inside instead of just grabbing a pastry or something for on the go. The Three Broomsticks offers 5 different breakfast options: American, Pancakes, British, Continental, and Porridge? Something like that. You stand in a queue (of course) and a truly dreadful woman nattered on and on about the dining plan (some pre-paid deal) while you were in the queue which was incredibly annoying. You order at one station, and then line up at another window and get your meal on a disposable plate and then find a table. The food was decent and heavy on the sausage and bacon for the full breakfasts. And there is a lot of food - none of us were able to finish our meals. It was a bit expensive, but not unexpected given you are in a theme park. The interior was dark and probably on a hot day would be very welcome. Apparently they have fairly good lunches and dinners. I wouldn't rush back for the breakfast, but might be willing to try a different meal.
If you like Harry Potter you'll enjoy the atmosphere in the dining room. The food tasted great and the portions were decent, but it was still overpriced as you should expect in a theme park. We had fish and chips and roasted chicken with potatoes and corn. The only reason I'm giving it an average is that it's not table service except for one meal - the family feast. I also found that the staff were not cleaning the tables as often as they should be. We cleaned our own table, which is not a big deal, but your table should be clean at these prices. Give it a try!
The family feast, served country style to your table. House salad, roasted chicken, roasted corn on the cob, ribs, home fried potatoes and broccoli. All good and quite a value and can feed a family of four easily...! Suggest that you have a light breakfast and eat there before noon as it can get busy at high peak times.
Just back from a week in Orlando with my 23 year old Harry Potter mad daughter.We stopped in at the adjoining Hogs head pub for a butterbear (tasty) and decided we may as well eat in the three broomsticks.When I say interesting it is because the decor moves and Windows appear on the wall and it is atmospheric.The food I found was good ,I had fish and chips and my daughter had the chicken,okay it is not haute cuisine but it is a fast food place after all.We enjoyed the experience.If you are a fan if the films check out the adjacent rest rooms as moaning Myrtle lives there
Very expensive lunch of fish n chips, and a little disappointing. The Fish and Chips we had when we were in England were fabulous, this fish however, was like Captain D's and the potatoes were blah. The dining room however, was fabulous and didn't miss one single detail. Loved the vaulted ceilings and old english decorations. They also had a full service bar in the back.
"We were attending the Harry Potter Celebration 23-27 Jan and reservations for breakfast at The Three Broomsticks was included in our package. We were directed to a cashier who rang up our order for 2 American breakfasts (nearly $38) which included scrambled eggs, bacon, fried red potatoes with onions, and a ""croissant"". Everything was cold and the potatoes were burned. The croissant tasted similar to a canned biscuit -- not light, flaky. The orange juice was good. We were extremely un-impressed with the breakfast and disappointed. We were seated at the table under the Three Broomsticks so that was cool. We tried to stay out of everyone's photos! We didn't experience bad service ... Just the lousy, cold food."
This restaurant does a great job of providing a quality experience with a cafeteria design. The food was excellent - my son and I had the fish and chips (double thumbs-up) and my wife had the pasties with a salad (she enjoyed it very much). The best part is that if you look up toward the roof you can see different scenes depicted as shadows on the walls and ceiling. But be quick because they don't last long! The onbly thing I found a little annoying was that the staff directs you where to sit............
This place definitely has character. It looked a lot like how I pictures it from the books. The food was very good, I got the Shepherd's Pie and was surprised by how much I liked it. I wish we would have gotten to pick our own seats though. But definitely worth the price! 
"Very surprised at how good the food was. You never know what to expect when is comes to big theme parks. It could look authentic and suck, this did not. It was great! I recommend that you do their ""Dining Plan"". It is much cheaper in the long run. You get the meal with drink, then another drink and snack that you can get in the park. Even though it looks like you are supposed to seat yourself they have ""Students"" that do so. You just need to have everyone in your party, trays in hand, at the ready. For the crazy amount of people that were there, it was quick service. I had the fish & chips and it was tasty. Other dishes were ribs, chicken and shepards pie. All were great. It was a fun experience that we all enjoyed. Me & my husband, our 8 yr old and my parents. So it ranged in age and we all liked it. A must do, especially for those that love Harry Potter, like myself. :-)"
"In January, very little wait time. Staff were skilled in directing us to the payment --> order/pick up --> find an open table objectives. You can't ""save"" a table; staff are shooing people out if they are just resting without eating. Very busy. Food is well above average; prob best place to order your pumpkin juice or ButterBeer because you can easily share it with friends and family (way too sweet to drink by yourself)."
The food is nothing special, but is a good counter service restaurant in Islands of Adventure.But what brings people here is the atmosphere. It is an awesome recreation of the movie, and even the food is british style. The decoration is great!We ordered salad with cornish pasties, ribs and chicken, along with Butterbeer (regular and frozen). But the best was the shepherd's pie... it was delicious. Consider making a Universal Dining Plan, it is accepted here and makes more value for your money, so you can save some money in dining.
Good for filling you with fat and proteins, especially if included into package price or because it rains and you have nowhere else to go. Ither than that makes no sense whatsoever
I was looking so forward to this experience. The Harry Potter World is worth going to but skip the Three Broomsticks Restaurant experience. I guarantee disappointment on this one. I had the American Breakfast. It was cold, and in a room with open doors (It was in the 60 F outside). 47$ for 3 people. A breakfast on a tray is given to you after you pay, so it's almost cafeteria style. Save your money on this one.
Horrible service, horrible staff, horrible food. Honestly the food was inedible. Save your money. Awful experience. 
We ate at the Three Broomsticks for a late lunch and breakfast on two consecutive days. Recommend the lunch platter for 4--a good value and offered carrots and broccoli along with the chicken and ribs. Breakfast options are good. Tried both the Full English and American. Good portions.To be clear, while our experiences at the Three Broomsticks was great, it's important to note that you dine at the Three Broomsticks for the atmosphere and the opportunity to marvel at the detailed Harry Potter world, and NOT for the food. Our kids loved the accurate rendering of the place. Each of our two meals, feeding our family of 5, came to around $75-$80. That's not inexpensive (especially for the breakfast), but it does seem to be one of the many prices to be paid to have the full HP experience.
"The atmosphere at this restaurant was amazing. The ceiling above is the best part as it has pretend upstairs levels. Besides that though it's all downhill. My family had 2 orders of fish & chips along with a child's chicken tender plate. The fish & chips were somewhat underneath fast food standards, with stale wedge fries and mediocre fish. I ordered the Hog's Head brew which was probably the best ""food item"" I ordered, but not really worth the $7-8. Basically, we paid over $50 for a Captain D's meal. Do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else, or just go in there for a beer only if you absolutely have to see the inside."
We shared the 'chicken and ribs platter for four', the food was lukewarm and greasy. Salad, corn and veg were alright. Chicken was greasy, ribs very fatty. Food is prepped in advance and kept warm (ish). When we arrived people were queuing out of the door, we came back later and the place was almost empty.The person who took our order was rude and disinterested. She seemed to resent being asked questions. Whilst we were waiting to pick up our food we were ignored whilst three members of staff messed about playing tricks on each other and discussed their shifts and evening activities.Only positive was the venue itself - very true to the book / film version. Very dark though so you can't really see what you are eating!I won't be going back.
The restaurant had a great design and it felt like you've stepped into a Harry Potter novel when you stepped into the restaurant. However, there are two cons - the menu is limited and the food was mediocre. However, since it does work as a quick dining service, you shouldn't expect too much. The system they have is quick, and even though there was a lineup, we were served quickly. Overall, I would definitely recommend to go, but focus on the experience more than the actual food.
I recommend the shepherd's pie and the butter beer. They were so good! The food comes out pretty quickly so you will not have to worry about spending too much time eating. The atmosphere fits with the whole Harry Potter theme.
A meal at the Three Broomsticks was a must for our family. My daughter is a HUGE Harry Potter fan the Wizarding World played a big role in our decision to come to Orlando this year. The wait was short and the process of ordering, picking up food, and finding a seat was really orderly and efficient. I had the fish and chips. It was the best meal I ate on the whole trip! Really well done. My husband had a slab of turkey, corn on the cob, and potatoes. His was okay, but he had food envy when he saw mine. My daughter wasn't thrilled with her mac 'n cheese as it was not Kraft macaroni and cheese. She doesn't give any other kind a fair shake.We sat where we could see the mounted hog's head in the other restaurant, The Hog's Head, and had fun watching it's animation.Super cool place to eat and a must-see for every Harry Potter fan!
The wait was short and the experience wonderful. This was best in-park value for any meal that we experienced on our trip to Orlando. The Shepard’s pie was excellent, the corn on the cob good and the potatoes were delicious. The ambiance and in-character aspect of the staff made for a fantastic experience, we were so glad we tried it.
The best quick serve in the park hands down. The food was plenty and the flavors were good. We had the chicken/rib combo and fish n chips and of course the butter beer. Highly recommend it for the experience and the food. 
Come on Universal, you need to start catering to vegetarians! We don't always want to eat cheese pizza or French fries. Personally, I prefer vegan items - so I won't eat cheese pizza or most veggie burgers because they contain eggs and I don't care for fried foods.That said we went to The Three Broomsticks several times for an afternoon snack. We enjoyed a frozen butterbeer and a baked potato.Other vegetarian items - corn on the cob, fruit cup, fries, apple pie?, and cake? (Sometimes it is hard to know if things are vegetarian). There is usually a book you can ask to see to check ingredients. We found the service to be quick and the staff friendly.On our last visit I was told a baked potato would be 10 minutes. After 15 I went back to the counter to check on where my potato was. The staff was very apologetic and gave me two free apple pies to eat while I waited - the kids helped eat those. I did eventually get my potato after about 20 minutes.
Wasn't expecting anything spectacular but was quite taken by the idea of some good old English pasties and we'd enjoyed the rest of Hogsmeade. The counter service was super quick and efficient. The pasties were nice enough but tiny, you'd get a good slap for serving anything like that up in the UK! I wasn't that hungry though after drinking Butterbeer ( a meal in a glass!) so it worked out quite well! My husband had the chicken and ribs platter which was quite tasty. It was overpriced as expected and they wanted you in and out quickly but it was good fun. The Butterbeer is lovely, I preferred the iced one though, it's like irn bru with a marshmallow-y butterscotch topping although half way through the glass you start feeling a bit sick. Worth a try!
This was a must for us while at Islands of Adventure. We had the Great Feast Platter which had plenty of food for us. The taste of the food was great. I thought the price was good knowing that theme park food is a little on the high side. They also have Gluten Free options!! One of our favorite meals on our vacation.
"This restaurant is part of the ""Harry Potter"" exhibit at Universal Studio Resort. For about $10.00 and something we all had the ""shepard's pie"" with salad and it was surprisingly tasty. I can't say much about anything else but service and atmosphere were all good. Of course the $100 fee for the park prohibits me from stopping there for lunch."
As a huge Harry Potter fan, Three Broomsticks was a must try on my recent visit to Universal Orlando Resort. We had lunch here and were completely satisfied. There was a short wait on line to enter, but once we did, we were quickly and efficiently directed to a cashier, then a pickup line, and then guided to a table. That whole process took about 5 minutes. The food is delicious (chicken, ribs) and the portions are generous. I ordered the Butterbeer and was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted - like a cream soda with a hint of butterscotch, with a vanilla foam on top. My only complaint was that it is rather dark inside - totally fits the theme, but it can be hard to take photos. I think this is one of the best meals in either Universal theme park.
My family thought we would experience some home cooking, we are from the UK. We didn't expect much but what we got was very poor. Fish & chips were cold. When I advised the waitress she returned with slightly warmer ones but still cold. Unbelievable. Not very helpful and some could say rude. When we left the small bearded chap asked if everything was ok. When I said no , he did apologise but that was it. 
Its theme park food, its nothing staggering, but the environment is awesome. we had an included free breakfast in our ticket package, and you can go back for lunch. its pre plated and not of great standard, but our meals were hot, tasty enough, and fun to eat in such epic surroundings.
Look, at the end of the day this is a cafe where you collect a pre-plated breakfast and a glass of OJ for $15, but the decor is great, you spend your time looking around in awe whilst chowing down on brekky. Bit pricey admittedly but in my opinion, worth it just for the experience. Probably wont go again but I would still recommend doing it just the once!
Dined here a couple of weeks back. The Woman serving on the till had major attitude and was so rude. Never smiled once. The food was terrible, cold and tasteless. I had the Fish & Chips(Wedges) which were bland. The Ice Cream dessert was manifactured and had no taste. For good Fish & Chips visit the Rose and Crown at Epcot's World Showcase. The Batter is imported from the UK. While at IOA visit one of the many fine Restaurants outside the park at City Walk.
"We stopped in at the Three Broomsticks yesterday while visiting Hogsmeade at Universal Studios, Orlando. We ended up splitting the chicken and ribs meal, which was plenty of food for the two of us. The chicken was served as a 1/2 chicken with the breast, thigh and leg, cooked in ""rotisserie style"". The rubs has a light rub on them and were exceptionally tender. Accompanying the meat was generous corn, on the cob, and roasted potatoes.On an earlier trip to Universal, we were with friends so we shared a Great Feast Platter, which is more of the same but done ""family style"" with enough food for four really hungry people.This, of course, is not a destination restaurant, but if you're visiting Universal Studios, this makes a great stop for lunch that's way above the normal theme park fast food. Actually, it's above normal fast food in terms of quality. The price is not out of line for theme park food either. Rather than feeding you deep fat fried whatever, you're getting actual food.While you're there, take a moment and look over the building. It looks like what you would expect a typical restaurant to look like in Hogsmeade. Very well done!"
We have been to Universal for the past three years but had never eaten here therefore we decided to give it a go this year. We were delighted with the quality of the food and it was reasonably priced too. Highly recommend the shepards pie and the corn, also the desserts are a treat. We will be returning here next year and will be eating here again. 
The Three Broomsticks was our favorite meal at Universal. The atmosphere is wonderful, the food was delicious (must recommend the fish and chips) and we thought it was fairly priced for a family of 6. We are headed to Universal again in a couple weeks and we can't wait to dine at The Three Broomsticks again!
Went for breakfast one morning, whilst in Harry Potter World. Whilst I get the theming, we found it to be a bit disappointing. Shared a couple of breakfast platters and american style pancakes- typical fast food, lukewarm and rubbery!Felt the layout was confusing and queues not managed as effectively as they could have been.Would go back in for a glass of butter beer, but would skip the food in future- didn't think the place was anything to shout about!
Fun atmosphere if you are a Potter fan. Food was good enough since we were able to take advantage of the on-site resort early entrance. We only had breakfast and I went basically only so I could get the blood sausage. When we ordered our food, the sausage was not available but they brought it to us later. Was not as good as I wished, but as good as you can get around this part of the world. We also were not able to get sodas, as they are just not available in that part of the park, but the butter beer was pretty good for a shot of sugar. We might return for lunch in the future just for a change of pace. The fruit plate was really great...good and cold for a hot Florida day.
Just got back from my Orlando to the theme parks, and I must say that the Three Broomsticks has the best theme food, except for the World Showcase at EPCOT. We had the Fish and Chips, the Ribs and the Meat Pies. All were great!! And the Hogsmeade Brew was quite tasty. I give this place the highest marks possible for quick theme park fare.
"Heard the fish and chips dinner was awesome here and I wasn't disappointed with the fish. Flaky, white, tasty. The atmosphere is great. However, my ""chips"" were on the cold side and not quite all the way cooked. However, I'd come back to try something else. "
The food was great the, atmosphere was awesome. It was a wonderful experience for the the whole family. I highly recommend!
This is the restaurant of choice for everyone in the family when we are at Islands of Adventure. We love the roasted chicken, potatoes, and vegetables. The kids love the butter beer. Sometimes can be hard to find a table. 
We really like this place for our lunch. The portions were huge.....consider sharing.....but freshly prepared and delicious
Three Broomsticks is an excellent value for the money. It's expensive, but our family of nine ate & got full for a decent cost. And we ate well! Salad, Ribs, Baked Chicken, Roasted Potatoes, Vegetables, Beef Pies...and the frozen butterbeer is wonderful. We even left lots of food behind! Of course, the Harry Potter theme park is an amazing treat, and this restaurant is a 'can't-be-missed' part of the experience.
The atmosphere is very relaxing and enjoyable. They serve continental, American and English breakfast. I wish you could have more characters in it. It is $15 for adults and $12 for children not including the drinks you should try the pumpkin juice.
Had fish and chips - food was good, could not finish most of it because of too much fried stuff. How about some low fat / non fried options to accompany meal? 
The atmosphere is excellent & you defnitely feel like you are in Harry Potter land.The problem though is that this place rests on the fact people are going to go there no matter what rubbish is served.We had breakfast and it is straight out of what I imagine a prison food hall would serve.The black pudding was dry and crumbly, the porridge was watery, the eggs make Mcdonalds look like a 5 star palace & there was this clear viscous like liquid when finished that was so off putting that I had to put my napkin over the plate to cover it up.This would be the worst breakfast I have ever had however because its Harry Potter world & we are all having a great time, I must admit the food really is probably secondary to the overall experience.Just don't expect any sort of cullinary delight.
We were a party of 5 so ordered the great feast (or whatever it's called). We all liked the salad, the roast potatoes were tasty if a bit oily and there was so much we couldn't finish it. There was a small amount of ribs (my boys liked it) and an adequate amount of perfectly acceptable roast chicken. But the best part was that we didn't sit in the noisy and dark interior, but out on the terrace, in an almost private little enclosure along the outside wall that resembled a castle battlement, in the shade, with a perfect view out to the water and Hogwarts castle. Was overall the best meal I've had in an amusement park.
We visited last Friday after going to the IoA and getting onto the Harry Potter ride in under 20 minutes (I won't say how but it works every time whatever the queue!!)The system here is that you enter and are allocated a servers counter which corresponds with a food servery number. Once you have food you are seated ( all tables are reserved to stop families blagging tables whilst food is collected).ths works really well and they are also doing this at Moe's Diner at the Simpsons ride.The atmosphere is faux medieval!! Done quite well as is all of this part of the park.Food I'd traditional English breakfast fare albeit they serve up croissant and jello with everything, even the full English!!Heinz baked beans served up together with good tea.
I was amazed on the speed that they seated people, yet did not rush you out. It is traditional fair, although they do have very full plates. The ribs were especially good, as was the butter beer.I would not miss the butter beer, once at least. They also have a full bar for grown up drinks. It is a rather long wait there though, as they had only one bartender on duty while there.
The architecture and creativity gets an A++ but the food is average theme park food (smoked turkey legs, etc). The cafeteria style service also took away from the magical allure of the facade. I think it could have been done with much more to offer if it were a sit down service restaurant. I did love the butter beer though, who would have known what we were missing!
Wasn't too crowded for lunch when we went in at 11:15 am, but on the way out there was a long line. The food was pretty good. I had a salad with rotisserie chicken with butterbeer. There was a longer line outside to get butterbeer from the cart than to sit down and eat in the 3 broomsticks. One bad thing: there are no bathrooms inside. I had to take my child out of the restaurant and to a bathroom out in the park, and re-enter the restaurant. This took a long time. It would have been good if the restaurant had a bathroom we could use while eating there.
Though we had to queue a bit before ordering, upon getting our food an employee helped direct us to an open table large enough to seat our party of nine. We had been concerned with the crowds that finding a spot would be difficult so we were delightfully surprised. The food was very tasty. Some of the menu items my party enjoyed were fish and chips, turkey legs, and fresh vegetables. The menu had a lot of great variety- even for someone like me with restricting allergies. The butterbeer was TOP NOTCH and the knick-knacks on the wall were fun to look at. A great lunch place if you happen to find yourself in Hogsmeade around midday.
When I heard that the Three Broomsticks was here, I imagined it so magical but in reality the atmosphere was a bit bland. It looked rustic enough but you have to pick your choice and pay at the till then collect and clear away your food yourself.I went for breakfast, we had either the English breakfast or the American. The food is very nice, potatoes, scrambled egg, pancakes, croissants, the grape jam was the best jam I have ever eaten. There was also a lovely older woman who worked there who was very polite :) I'd recommend it if you haven't had breakfast yet the food is really good however I was slightly disappointed as I didn't feel the magic
"Great place for some breakfast if you're in the park for early hours and very well themed. They've got all the traditional breakfast choices, like pancakes, eggs, sausage, bacon, blood sausage, and croissant. It's not hard to mess up breakfast so everything was very good here.The nice thing is that you have a choice to get butterbeer here with your meal also as your beverage or you can also add it on to your meal. This way you don't have to get it out the kiosk outside.A nice touch is the Universal staff here seat you, being from California and accustomed to ""dibs"" system of table seating it was refreshing to not have to scrabble for tables or split up the group one person order and one person sits at the table reserving space."
Have tried several menu items over multiple visits. Butter Beer is fantastic, I prefer the cold, not frozen, but each individual has different tastes. The peanut butter and strawberry ice cream was a nice treat on a hot day. Portions are large, my wife and I usually split a meal there.
We were there early so we had breakfast, we bought 2 entrees and had enough food for 4 people. The ButterBeer was very good. I loved the décor and atmosphere. I would totally recommend going in for the experience. Lines were not too long at 8:30am.
After walking around the park for hours we were ready to sit, relax and re-energize with some good food and was not disappointed! We had about a 15 minute wait to get a table inside even though it wasn't crowded and was surprised to discover that it wasn't an actual sit-down style restaurant. We selected our dishes and brought them over to the table we wanted. The building and decor was very interesting keeping with the Harry Potter theme. The food portions were very generous and tasty! We had the chicken, turkey leg, ribs and fish & chips with our party and they were all very delicious - of course we were very hungry as well so I don't know how much that contributed to it! We also tried the home beer which was an ale that was similar to a Killians. The kids tried the Butterbeer which was fantastic as was the pumpkin juice.I would definitely eat here again during my visit to Islands of Adventure!
The Three Broomsticks at Universal is located back in the Harry Potter Area. The building itself is very cool, they did an AMAZING job designing the whole area. This is like a cafeteria. You go through a line and order your food, then you have to pay, then you have to find a seat. I really wish they would have made this a typical restaurant, where you had a server and waitstaff could really integrate you into the world of Harry Potter. It can be IMPOSSIBLE to get a seat in here. Now with all that said, I still LOVE this place. The food is amazing, and surprisingly, the cost is not too bad for what you get. Highly reccommend!
The bad were long lines to pay your dish, but we try the great feast platter and this was awesome , American food is lack of flavour but this dish was spectacular, . By far best we ate in Orlando Be aware about butterbear..... We didn't like it.
This place is very cool for a theme park eatery and the food is better than average, too. After waiting in line for about 15-20 minutes, we entered into what I would describe as a Harry Potter-style dining hall. They offered turkey legs, shepherds pie, salads, fish and chips, etc and a nice variety of beverages. We placed our order in line #6 and walked a few feet over and picked our order up from the line also marked #6. This was actually very quick and organized ...very unlike many parks are. Once we had our food, a hostess escorted us to the dining table. The ambience is cool. The people, friendly. We were all satisfied and FULL after eating. The food wasn't greasy, hadn't been sitting under a heat lamp, or otherwise like some of the nightmare food you get in many of these types of places. Best of all: while it may cost slightly more (you would expect higher prices at a theme park, anyway...but this is a sit down meal), the amount of food you get for the price is better than average. $13/under fir the majority. The kids LOVED IT. Recommend!
The Three Broomsticks was our favorite meal throughout all of our vacation. We had been on a cruise to the Bahamas and visited the theme parks before flying home. In all 7 days, this was by far one of the best. I had rotisserie chicken and ribs (the best of my life) along with roasted potatoes and corn on the cob. The fare reminds you of the food at shows such as Dixie Stampede or Medeival Times, but at a fraction of the cost. My bf and I both ate HUGE meals for a total of $30. There is zero wait time after you order your meal, and the atmosphere is awesome. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
We arrived at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter with early admission. The only thing open was the Journey ride which we had already ridden two days before, so we decided to have breakfast at the Three Broomsticks. The food was really good and the atmosphere was fantastic! My son's and I are all about Harry Potter and really enjoyed this top notch environment. My husband expressed it was a little pricey for breakfast ($63.00) but we ate everything and enjoyed it. Kids had butterbeer and pumpkin juice. Counter service but very well organized. Would recommend especially for families.
This themed restaurant in Harry potter serves American theme park versions of British classics, such as mini cornish pasties (three per portion), fish and chips and ribs with sweet corn (????). Food is ordered at tills and then collected at seperate counters and then you can find a table. As we had our hands full with food trays and a 5 week old baby (strollers are left outside) a member of staff offererd to help us find a table and we decided to sit outside at the rear where there is covered seating with shades, fans, good views and some breeze, though it doesn't have the ambience of inside the restaurant. The food is adequate but the hogsheads beer is a credible version of an English ale.
I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. So it was only fair that I eat in this cool little restaurant. The decor is very similar to a pub in London. The food is what blew me away! My family and I got the feast for four. Plenty of food for my family of six! The chicken was seasoned well and the corn and potatoes were cooked just right. We spent two days at Universal Islands of Adventure and ate there both days! They even serve butterbeer in the pub so you don't have to wait in line for one outside. They also serve beer (get it in a collectible mug) in the mug that you can't find elsewhere. Overall the cost was reasonable for theme park prices. We paid a lot more in other parks for food half this good. A good word of advice...if you can eat lunch early great! The restaurant fills up quickly after noon. We arrived right after breakfast was over and was served immediately!
Our daughter was so excited about having dinner here. The food was good. She had shepherds pie and we had fish n chips. The staff are dressed in costume and the decor of the pace is amazing. Well worth a visit.
My 10-year old, who never cares where we eat, begged that we could go to the Three Broomsticks during our visit to Universal Orlando. He was in heaven the entire time. The atmosphere was great, and the food as well. We all enjoyed the butter beer (preferred the frozen), I enjoyed the shepherd's pie, and my husband and kids split the feast (a pretty good value for the amount of food you get).We arrived for an earlyish lunch about 11:30 and got in without too much waiting. By the time we left the line was fairly long. Also they offer a AAA discount, so definitely ask for it, 15% off was a good deal.
Can't say enough about Three Broomsticks. We've eaten lunch here before and loved it. The atmosphere is fantastic. It's ounter-service. They have a very organized process of ordering and pick up plus they seat you so there's none of that wandering around with your tray looking for a table that is available and clean. This time we went to 3B for breakfast. Wow! what a surprise. Delicious hot breakfast - lots of choices (American, British, etc), and nice portions. A great way to start off our day in The Wizarding World. 
"Great atmosphere and really good food. If you need a break from the typical amusement park food and want ambiance to go along...this is a great option. The food was very good and fresh. We enjoyed the ""Feast"" which was quite a bit of food and very good. Be sure to look for little surprises throughout the restaurant while you eat ;-). Definitely recommend. And of course, the butter beer...regular or frozen, is very good! "
After an early arrival (7:15am) to WWHP we had finished riding the rides, drinking Butter Beer and visiting Ollivanders by 10:00! We checked Three Broomsticks to see if they were still serving breakfast and learned that they were transitioning into lunch. So we stayed and had lunch....no line! The fish and chips were wonderful...a must try. The rotisserie chicken was good, typical, but good. We also had chicken fingers and they were about as good as the fish and chips...fresh and tender. The wait staff was friendly and helpful in seating us and clearing the table. It was a wonderful and welcome way to relax after the excitement of the rides.
The plan was to eat at The Three Broomsticks for my birthday but my boys opened the restaurant door and the smell of fishy fried fish was too much to take LOL So I ran in and ordered a frozen butterbeer to go with the souvenir mug....much faster than waiting in line outside at the cart in the heat. I highly advise going in to look around-very well done and 3 times the size on the inside.
Our kids were all smiles the entire time in Wizards' World. The day we ate lunch at Three Broomsticks was definitely magical. We planned our whole day around eating an early lunch here. It was so worth it. The food was actually really good. The atmosphere alone was worth the price of the meal. 
I had the shepherd's pie while the hubby got the bigger meal of rib, chicken and corn, it was good. I liked the ambience, it was something different. Where else can you find such a restaurant that will bring you to Hogsmeade? The waitstaff were dressed in costume, cool! Though they have their own drinks, lemonade and the butterbeer, or water. Give it a try for the experience.
"I had looked up all I could involving the Three Broomsticks online before going, but no matter what reviews said, I wanted to go just for the sake of saying I had been there. Ever since reading Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, I thought to myself, I must go into this pub before I die. Now, maybe I just got lucky on the day I went (Saturday, about 11:45 am) or maybe 2 is the lucky number, but despite the crowds outside, my best friend and I were able to walk straight in, go up to the display case which had all the luncheon/dinner meals out, and place our orders. We waited probably thirty seconds before a hostess asked how many we were and directed us to two separate registers since we were paying separately. After we ordered at the numbered register, we proceeded to the corresponding pick-up line. I knew what there was to order pre-entry, but there are three separate menus for the entrees, drinks, and desserts. Off the top of my head, I know that there's Shepherd's Pie, Cornish Pasties, Rotisserie Chicken, Fish and Chips, Ribs, Chicken Salad, and the Great Feast Platter which includes a bit of everything for adults. Kids have their choice of macaroni and cheese, fish and chips, chicken tenders, and the like. Beverages include butterbeer, normal or ICEE style, pumpkin juice, pumpkin fizz, coffee, tea, and a few others I didn't look at. Desserts are the strawberry/peanut butter ice cream Harry eats in book 3 in Diagon Alley, some type of pudding ,and something else I can't remember.I ordered the salad and a butterbeer which came out to around $13, if memory serves correctly. After picking up my order I grabbed utensils from a station against the wall on the far left and then walked with my tray over to the seating area. Another staff member asked me how many again, and picked out a nice corner table for my friend and me so that we could view the restaurant and eat. Music from the fifth film (Umbridge's theme) played overhead. The salad had rotisserie chicken without skin, Iceberg Lettuce, a few croutons, cucumbers, and tomatoes, and my choice of dressing. I ate about a third of it and let my friend with his enormous appetite finish it off with the rest of his fish and chips which he thoroughly enjoyed. It wasn't because I didn't like the dish, however, that I didn't finish it; I was just lacking an appetite because I was too excited to see the rest of the village. As for the taste, Macaroni Grill serves one of my favorite salads and this was more of a pre-made store-bought tasting salad, but I didn't mind the price or taste (but then again, I'm not picky with my veggies and I was only paying for me). The butterbeer was actually for my brother as a promised souvenir. He asked for butterbeer and nothing else (I'm from Colorado, so I had to find some way to get it on the plane since they don't sell it in bottles like they do pumpkin juice). I had an empty water bottle intended for this purpose and poured the butterbeer in there to be stored in my luggage for the return journey. (One week later, my brother told me it still tasted amazing, so I guess that despite the lack of foam, that stuff keeps fresh). It was about one fifth foam and the rest was the actual ""beer"". It tasted like a root beer/butterscotch cream soda with a marshmallowy foam. I had one gulp and it was very sweet, but personally I prefer pumpkin juice.But it was the details, THE DETAILS that I came for, and boy did I get them! Projected shadows of witches entering rooms upstairs and owls swooping through the rafters play every few seconds and rickety wooden staircases twist every which way upwards and out of sight. I read that this was actually built before filming of The Half-Blood Prince, so the one in the film is modeled after the restaurant! I wanted to go up those steps and explore the rest of the tavern, but it's a ""Muggles Prohibited"" area, so, oh, darn, couldn't go up. Still, the atmosphere, with the exception of Muggle-dressed tourists, was incredibly realistic.The staff all wore costumes/uniforms that one might find in the Wizarding World and though most of them were teenagers and young adults just content to have a job, they made sure to address us tourists as Muggles to stay somewhat in character. No accents, authentic or improvised. Working in any food guest service place can be wearisome and stressful (I work at a movie theater, so I understand) and so that would explain the somewhat forced smiles and bored demeanors, but I encountered no rudeness (other reviews have said otherwise, but again, I may have gotten lucky), Though underage (by a mere THREE MONTHS), I could still go over to the Hog's Head section which is connected to the Three Broomsticks near the back. There are multiple taps, a few shrunken heads, some wooden barrels, and the infamous boar's head behind the bar. You're allowed to take pictures even if you're not of legal drinking age. From here you can exit back into Hogsmeade, or go back out the Three Broomsticks entrance.So, to recap: a bit pricey--it's Harry Potter, what do you expect?-but you have to order an actual food item if you want to get a seat for the Three Broomsticks (I'm not sure what the policy is for the Hog's Head). I didn't mind the food. It was average and I probably wouldn't eat there again if I return (I plan to!) unless I was starving or wanted to get some more pictures. I had packed a protein bar, so if you don't want to spend that much money, that's your best bet. I'm a picky eater, but like I said, not with my veggies, so the lack of Romaine didn't bother me. Lettuce is lettuce. I can't speak for the other meals, though according to other reviews, the food is sometimes great, sometimes awful. It wasn't the food I went for, remember, but the decor, which gave me tingles when I found myself temporarily transported into the Wizarding World."
The main reason for dining here would be the ambience. It is immersive, and beautiful. It is a depiction of the pub in Hogsmeade, obviously called the Three Broomsticks.The food unfortunately is your average theme park fare - I did enjoy the Hogs Head brew, an alright beer but again nothing special, but the novelty is there! We also enjoyed a Butterbeer (me and my partner) which was a butterscotchy sort've drink, almost a dessert. Great served frozen under the hot Florida sun!Rated more very good over average due to the ambience. Would be damn good if the food was better!Note: Look out for owls flying (not real!) and house elves cleaning the upstairs areas!
Don't miss Three Broomsticks when you are visiting Hogsmeade. It's easily overlooked as you meander through the village, but make sure you stop in for a meal, especially if you don't notice a line. The food is better than average and is a unique experience that completes your Harry Potter experience! 
This restaurant is in the Harry Potter section of Islands of Adventure. It has a cool decor and a great system to get you to a table quickly. It is a tray service restaurant but they have roast chicken and ribs and great roasted corn on the cob. It was a little expensive but we took two souvenir mugs of Butterbeer.... Soooooo sweet at first but then I found myself craving some later on in the day. It's worth the stop instead of the standard hotdog and hamburger.
was expecting the worse when we went here to get out of the rain for a while, based on other comments and since in a theme park. The food was not cheap, but at least not the same menu as the rest of the park. I had pasties and a salad, and although it was not a big portion, was fresh and the pasties were not bad. My wife had the chicken, which again was better than some of the other things we have eaten in parks. Overall much better than I thought. Keep an eye out too, there were lots of small details (like the boar head moving behind the bar) that we kept seeing, it was fun.
Whatever you do, do NOT try the so calledEnglish breakfast. it is truly appalling. I really cannot belive that JKR sanctioned that. the black pudding was boiled mot fried, the baked beans were like bullets and the rest - well, I just left it. Wish I'd chosen the American breakfast instead. The theming is excellent but food wise......................2 out of 1o at best.
My son insisted on eating here but I had my reservations as I had read the reviews on TA. The reviews were spot on. The food is horrible but it is such a cool atmosphere that I was okay with it. I had the rotisserie chicken salad (stay away from it!) my son had the ribs which he said were okay. Of course, we had butter beers and admired the restaurant for what is was. I mean, where else can you eat where Harry Potter and friends have?
The Three Broomsticks is big on value, theme, and service and low on price. Although it is a counter service restaurant the quality of the food, and indeed the entire experience, is on par with table service restaurants. If you are a family you will not go wrong with the family meal (which is very large and very affordable which is, sadly, mostly unheard of in the theme park restaurant world). I also recommend the Shephard's Pie and the Fish and Chips. The drink selections are all amazing (although I have not tried the signature real beer they have on tap). Pumpkin Juice, Butter Beer, Pear Juice ... they are all worth trying. If you are a Harry Potter fan then you really owe it to yourself to spend time looking around in the restaurant, and be sure to pay attention to the special effects that pop up from time to time. Like most things in Universal's Hogsmeade Area, the restaurant could be a little larger, but at least it isn't as small as the shops (or the locker rental area for the ride at Hogwarts). Even if you are not a Harry Potter fan, you will find a good meal at very good price at The Three Broomsticks.
We had a breakfast that was included with our vacation package. It was very good! We had the American breakfast, lots of food! Next time I want to try the fish and chips for sure!
My family and I had the family feast and really enjoyed the food. We were very surprised by the quality or a restaurant located in the park. The food and service was great. 
Everything we had here was good. Tried the ribs, the chicken, the Cornish pasties and the apple pie. Best part about it was that it all cost us around $32. That is close to what is cost for us to eat dinner at a chain restaurant. Great deal.
We just returned from a week at Disney/Universal. I had heard that Three Broomsticks in Harry Potter World in Universal was a good place to eat and I heard correctly! There was a family meal for $49.95 (good value in and Orlando theme park) that included salad, chicken, ribs, corn, veggies and potatoes ... all which tasted absolutely delicious. They even have a system for seating where, after you have your food, you are escorted to a table which means you don't have to go around looking for one. The food was excellent and a pleasant find ... fantastic alternative to the typical theme park fare of fast food. The amount was plentiful for 4 ... and we can eat!
Old pub environment, as in the movie. For those who already like England and Fish and Chips plate, it pays to take advantage of this restaurant within the Harry Potter Park. The food is tasty, buttery beer available .Special place for Harry's fans .
...should you go here. It's park food, so I didn't expect anything gourmet, or even great, but I was pretty disappointed. My family (family of 4) got the Great Feast, which is basically a combo of everything on the menu: corn on the cob, potatoes, ribs, chicken, and a garden salad, plus an order of pasties. The pasties, to me, tasted like a dry Hot Pocket, the chicken was dry, and while the ribs were meaty, they lacked sauce. I got the frozen Butterbeer, which was decent-- but very, very, sweet! Even the atmosphere I didn't care for: it's open, so (very brave) pigeons fly in and eat, it's dark, and the ordering setup is kind of confusing. But it does, I think, match the description of The Three Broomsticks in the books.
This is a neat place to sample something different at Universal. Atmosphere here cannot be beat. Right in the middle of the wizard ing world of Harry Potter. Definitely over priced, as everything here is, but one if the few places that may be worth it! 
I'm wavering on average on this one, but give it the extra bump up to Very Good since it was in the Islands of Adventure, not a standalone eatery, and we were there at the very end of the day. There were six of us eating, so we had a pretty broad variety. I took a poll around the table, and got mostly OK votes. I had the Leek and Onion soup with a side salad. The soup suspiciously tasted and had the consistency of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom without any mushrooms...The salad was reasonable but the salads appeared to all be pre-made and by dinner time were getting a little rough around the edges. Other entrees included the ribs and chicken, which were rated a 3 by my son (chicken kind of dry, ribs ok but nothing special), Fish and Chips were good. I tried the Hog's Head Brew. Not my type of beer, but it was good for that kind of Scottish brew. The ButterBeer was good as always! Price was much more reasonable than the Kitchen at the Hard Rock Hotel. I think we should have tried the Shepherd's Pie or the pasties, maybe next time.
This is not a place you go because it's gourmet. That said the food was decent. To save some money, share a plate. The ribs and chicken plate was more than enough for my wife and myself to share. We spent about $20 for the two of us, with drinks. The butter beer (non-alcoholic) is basically a cream soda with butterscotch syrup. Don't get duped into buying the $7 mug. It's not worth it. Plenty of seating, and a cooled indoor area make this a nice spot to take a load off and refresh for more adventure.
We used to eat here before it became part of Hogsmeade and it was ok. We decided to try it on our last visit and were pleasantly surprised. Ordered Fish & Chips and Shepherds Pie. Fish was lightly battered and very tasty, the Shepherds Pie had a bit too much mashed potatoes but was well seasoned and attractively presented. We ate outside which has more shade now than it did previously. It is still counter service but we moved along quite quickly.
That was a great English breakfast! My advice is to eat here and if you don't know what black pudding is, eat it first then ask...muggle
It gets better busy and you feel rushed. The food is fair and the price is high but we are not big Harry Potter fans so if you are may want to check it out. It is pretty fast to get food. May want to consider it if you are looking for a place to cool off and happen to be in this area of IOA otherwise I would walk to Mythos
We were greeted by a super friendly hostess, who showed us to the line to wait in to get to the cash register. After waiting a short period (maybe 10 minutes) in line we arrived at a cash register to order our food and then moved over to another counter to receive the food. Because we were a large party (6 people) with a wheelchair, we got to sit in the back in the bar. If you are seated there, look for the bull. My kids got a kick out of it! The food (I got the English Breakfast, my girls got the pancakes and everyone else got the American breakfast) was mediocre at best. But honestly, are you there to enjoy the food or the atmosphere that is The Three Broomsticks? I was there to soak it all in. My food was a little on the cold side but well prepared. More beans would've been nice. My daughter says her pancakes were delicious.The order taker happened to tell me that they had GF pancakes, but I didn't try them. Go here, without expectations of fantastic food and you won't be disappointed. My kids enjoyed it all! (And Mommy maybe did too.....)
The service was great even on a very busy Sunday of Memorial weekend. The atmosphere is excellent, the place really adds to the whole Harry Potter experience. The place is not expensive, we spent 60.00 for a family of four including drinks and there was a lot of food.The food was below average, we ordered the feast, and the veggies, corn and salad were good. The meat however was rubber, no taste whatsoever....the plate included chicken and ribs and neither had flavor. For us to leave food on the table is a no no but this time sadly we had to. If you are looking for the experience sure but not the food.Oh the Butterbeer is really good!!!
We ate here over spring break week this year. While the crowds were pretty bad the whole day, the wait times in here were surprisingly not bad. They were really efficient in getting us in and out quickly. Plus, waiting in line gave us time to take in the whole atmosphere. Everything is themed so perfectly, it feels like you're really in the Harry Potter universe and any fan is sure to love it.The food was really delicious and decently priced for a theme park. The butterbeer was absolutely awesome! Make sure to take your time to take in all the little details. As a family full of HP fans, we were very pleased. Would definitely come back!
This restaurant really brings the whole Harry Potter experience home! My wife had the turkey leg and I tried the fish and chips. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals with no room left for dessert! The decor is exactly what is expected of the Harry Potter world. A definite recommendation for fun cuisine and good service. For a bit of additional enjoyment, look lively around the fireplace...a fun surprise shows up spontaneously!
"I was holding my breath when the kids ""had to eat"" at the Three Broomsticks. We decided to give the family platter a try for $45 and was more than pleasantly surprised when we they brought the tray out. There was plenty to eat; large pieces of chicken, corn on the cob, vegetables, roasted potatoes. Of course, we had to get butter beer in a commemorative cup. The atmosphere was fun and really made you feel as though you were in the book. Watch for the ghost shadows to appear in various places."
I was very surprised by the food at the 3 broom Sticks Restaurant in Harry Potter World. Prices were fair, and the food: ribs, corn on cob, potatoes, was very good. Exceeded by expectations of theme park food!!
We loved the experience of eating here. It was like being in the books.. The prices were reasonable and the food was really good. 
There can be a wait here, but if you're mindful of the time and keep an eye on the entrance to this place as you move around in this part of the park, you can get in fairly quickly. We had lunch here and it was very good. Everyone had plenty to eat and it was no more expensive than getting a burger at one of the other park restaurants. Will be eating here again on next visit.
The food here is amazing! While sitting and eating you look around and feel like you are actually sitting in the real Three Broomsticks from the movie! Make you sure grab a frozen butterbeer with your meal you will not regret it!
Super cool place to grab a bite. Neat setting and close to the entrance of Harry Potter. Character breakfast served here. food is good and price is reasonable. Ours was included with park resort.
Limited menu with friendly service. Good atmosphere with Harry Porter theme and okay value. Food quality was good for a sit down lunch at Universal Studios.
As many other reviews seem to say here the surroundings and theme are excellent but as for value well the breakfast we had was just OK but VASTLY overpriced for what you get.In fact what we got was almost identical to the Pastamore breakfast in citywalk the difference Pastamore $28,Three Broomsticks $65. As this is the resort that is about to outDisney Disney by adding new Harry Potter rides in the other park thus meaning everyone has to pay twice as much to buy a park hopper ticket to see all the Wizarding World we shouldn't really be surprised should we ?
We were there for spring break and waited 25 minutes online to get into the restaurant to wait yet again online to order, pay and pick-up our food. The food had cute names but was average and not very hot by the time we were given a table. There looked like a nice outdoor seating area. You carry your own tray of food and drinks which they don't put lids on so be prepared to spill!!! The person in front of us spilled their lemonade all over their pea soup and drumstick.
My husband and I enjoyed both Universal parks recently and were so glad to spend the majority of our day at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. It looks just like it does in the movies. My husband and I were both in awe of all the details put into the decor and structure of the entire building. HP fans will enjoy seeing the mechanics moving above your dining area and seeing photos of wizards all about the walls. My husband had the fish and chips. He said that it was surprisingly fresh tasting and the chips were hot. I had the roast chicken with potatoes and corn. The corn was sweet, potatoes were seasoned well, and the chicken was really moist and tender. We each had a butterbeer, which we both thought was delicious and were glad to have tried a ficticious drink! The service was good. After ordering, you pick up your food from a separate counter. After that, a seating guide will direct you to another person who actually tells you what table to sit at. Overall, it was a good lunch to add to our HP experience. I would eat here again if ever we returned.
I was with my family of thee adults and one child and was very close to complaining as it was poor. We had breakfast and paid 15 dollars each and less for my son but paid 51 dollars in total. The service was ok, the guy on the door was welcoming, (he was the best bit). The food was an average sized plate of ok food at best food, some of a cooked breakfast was cold and my daughters bacon was 90% fat. For 51 dollars this was the worst restaurant I went to. If you were a major Harry Potter fan then the surroundings may make up for it a bit but if you are looking for good food and value for money forget it.
"We decided to try The Three Broomsticks. After all, we Were in the world of Harry Potter. The butter beer was unique and son loved the mug. We had the fish n' chips and were a bit shocked to see that our total for three of those, one butter beer and 2 cokes came to $50. We don't usually budget that kind of cash for lunch. So that was a lesson learned. They did seem to have a few ""family"" platters that would have saved money, but those didn't offer what we wanted to eat. The atmosphere and theming is cute if you have kids that are into Harry Potter. If you're just wanting to try the butter beer, and the lines in the kiosks outside are too busy, there is a side bar to Broomsticks that serves butter beer and alcohol. We learned that after the fact and will certainly remember it next time. After laying out $50 for fish n' chips, I could have used a nice cold one myself."
Great food freshly done and lots of flavor! You won't be disappoint after the long lines and not so friendly staff, this restaurant is a hidden treasure inside universal
Stumbled in after waiting 90 minutes to go on the Harry Potter ride. Although the inside carries a strong resemblance to the atmosphere at the Country Bear Jamboree, it was (relatively) quiet at 11 AM on a sunny day, especially compared to the busy street outside. The had an English breakfast with all of its fried components, plus a reasonable croissant, and black pudding that shared the same dubious provenance with stuff we had at the Mayfair in London last year. Not sure what was in the 'Pumpkin Juice' but it wasn't bad. It would be more fun if they added a few animated touches, like some of the many effects from inside Hogwarts, or perhaps a statue of the proprietor, Mr Dumbledore.
"Our family ate here while in the land of Harry Potter for the experience. Our middle son is the biggest Harry Potter fan and really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. We had a variety of food, I had the Shepard's Pie. It was just ok. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food though. It was chilly the day we were there so we sat inside in a large, curved corner booth. You order at the window, pick up your food and find somewhere to sit. There are employees to help you find a table. There is a nice area out in the back to sit (too cold that day) but we sat out there later with a butter beer and you can see the top of the ""castle"" which houses the ride. Kind of a picturesque place to sit. I would eat here because there are not many choices if you want to stay in the Harry Potter area and because any Harry Potter fan will get a kick out of it."
Loved the look of the restaurant-definitely loved the creativity throughout. The food was also really good. Loved the turkey and corn on the Cobb. Of course you have to have a butter beer with your meal!!! Good prices.
"With such great theming everywhere else in WWoHP, and with everything I read, I'll admit I was a little disappointed here. Food was good (we order the family feast), but there's a crowded cafeteria feel to the place, with little to ""marvel"" at, as I'd hoped."
The food was very good. Lighter than expected! We had salad with cornish pasties. Priced similarly to meals elsewhere in the park (but better than usual burgers and hotdogs elsewhere). Great atmosphere!
"Recently visited the Island of Adventure theme park.. as my daughter is a Harry Potter nut. When booking through the Orlando Universal site.. the customer service person said the Broom Stick Breakfast was part of our package.. we had to even book a time to go. Well we were there at 9 a.m. and walked in... there didn't seem to have a need for a reservation people were walking in and buying breakfast.Your choices were very limited and were a complete meal. They did have a healthy fruit choice. We both had the English version of breakfasts. So because we were already reserved and I guess paid for (with our booking) we then waited in another line and got our food on a tray. It didn't look very appetizing at all. Oh I must add the cost was well over $15.00 a person...which had I known I would not have paid for in my package. Everything was cold. The coffee was luke warm. The eggs were runny.... and that was it. 'We thought that it was going to be some sort of show - ""Broomstick Breakfast"" because we had a reservation at 9 etc. like they do at Disney... no such thing!. It is bascially a cafeteria. The serving staff (cleaning tables) were very nice and when I told the lady about my food she was very apologetic and went to the kitchen and got me a HOT meal and HOT coffee. My daughter was so turned off it she didn't want a NEW hot meal.Also there were pigeons in the restaurant.. and while we were there a bird pooped on a lady's arm.. I wonder if it ever lands on someones plate. They fly around and sit in the rafters right over head while you eat. I didn't see any staff trying to get birds out of the restaurant? I definately would never go back and would advise that it is way too much for what you get. I don't particularly blame the restaurant for the low expectations of thinking it was some sort of show.... the customer service person at Universal that sold us the deal.. should have told us it was just a restaurant for breakfast....."
From the entrance, The Three Broomsticks was already exceeding my expectations. From start to finish, it truly felt like we were there. We did not have to wait in line for long, but we were there for an early lunch, around 11:15. There were many healthy options to choose and the food was not bad at all! We opted for fish and chips and the roasted chicken platter. They were even able to sub roasted veggies for corn. For park food, prices were not completely unreasonable and I feel it is worth it for the dining experience you receive. Attendants find a table for you and it is nice to have someone else worry about seating! We ordered the butterbeer while we were here and it saved us from the long lines outside. While you eat, you are surrounded by props straight from the movie. Be sure to stop here for lunch or dinner, and get a butterbeer foam mustache to complete the experience!
"I had the oportunity to have lunch at the Three Broomsticks in Islands of Adventure while visiting this attraction in March 2013. The wait was well worth it as the food was great. We all had the fish and chips and was not disappointed in the least. The restaurant itself was right out of the movie and it could not have been better. If you were lucky enough and watched carefully you might see an Owl cross across the walls or perhaps see a shadow of a house elf on the walls. My husband said he was a shadow of Serious Black. The whole experience was amazing and I would not have missed it for the world. The price was great and the food was great. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone who has watched these ""Harry Potter"" movies, I do think they would enjoy the whole experience."
What an amazing experience. This was my 2nd time visiting. The food is really good and you must try the frozen butterbeer!! If you are a fan of the movies you will notice all the little details while sitting there looking around. Harry's suitcases are upstairs next to his door, etc. It is amazing how they made this restaurant feel so real....you might think Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are going to walk in any minute! ha ha
We ate here twice during a 3-day Universal Trip. Order the Great Feast if you have at least 4 hungry people--a decent salad to start, then a cookie sheet-sized tray loaded with fall-off-the-bone ribs, corn still in the husk, roasted skin-on potatoes, mixed veggies (broccoli, carrots and lots of red bell peppers), and 1/4 chicken per person. Go during an off-peak time for the best service and your pick of tables, and use a AAA card for 10% off (works at all Universal Orlando sit down restaurants and gift shops).Tips and Tricks: You can order the Great Feast ($49.99 for 4) at breakfast time if you ask, we got ours at 10:30am to avoid the crowds. If you want a Butter Beer, buy it early on your first day in a $7 souvenir mug--you can get soft drink refills in either park for $0.99 (bring it on future days to really save money). Politely ask a server for a free soft drink refill (tea or soda--they won't do it for the Butter Beer).
We enjoyed eating breakfast so much at the Three Broomsticks that we ate there three times. The staff is very friendly and the whole atmosphere of the place is perfect. It was not crowded when we got there at about 9:30. We had lunch there as well once but the breakfast was more interesting, esp. the traditional English Breakfast. Definitely worth trying the Three Broomsticks at least one time with your family. Absolutely LOVE the pumpkin juice!
The food here is really cafeteria level food. We had the breakfast included with our package, so we went. It was fine--nothing too bad, but nothing delicious either. But the atmosphere is awesome. However, it's better to just go to the Hog's Head for a pint of butterbeer and walk around. 
Universal did an AMAZING job designing the Three Broomsticks. Once you get past the cash registers, you really feel like you're in the Potter books. While some of the food can be purchased other places in the park (like the turkey legs), it feels different when you eat it in that environment. Most of the staff are pretty friendly which is nice considering alot of the other Potter staff are somewhat rude. The fish and chips is VERY good (if you like fried fish). The chicken is good. The corn on the cob was a bit mushy. Lots of fun drink selections. The deck outside is fun. I also like how the Hogs Head pub just blends right into the end. Great use of space. Also, if you get a chance to sneak out to the restrooms right outside, it's fun to hear Moaning Myrtle talk. I would just try to make sure you don't go during peak times unless you are prepared for quite a wait. That part of the park gets VERY busy and sometimes there is a line to even get INTO the Potter area. 
Very few menu choices and no allowed to chop and change menu items. Also not permitted to order from the kids menu if over 16. This restaurant is extremely busy therefore after counter service you need to queue again to be shown to a table. When eating the waiting staff were constantly passing by the table looking to clear up. When we had all finished our food and still drinking our drinks we were asked to move on!!!
Like most theme parks, the food was pricey. The atmosphere was fun as it was in the Harry Potter area of Universal. The Butter Beer is the bomb! We were really trying to taste the flavors to see if we could replicate it at home:) Anyhow, it was very cold the day we went, and unfortunately it was cold in the restaurant as well. The food was decent. We had the chicken. The coffee was STRONG! Service was quick and cordial. Don't forget to use your AAA discount!
We have eaten here twice at universal and they have the best food, with the shortest line, and it has the best ambience. You really heel like to are eating in the Hogwarts cafeteria. It is best to have short line before 11 or after 2pm. The family feast is the best deal with chicken, ribs, 4 ears of corn, roasted potatoes, and roast broccoli and peppers. This can even feed four adults! Even if you order a smaller plate, it is the quickest real meal and not fast food at Universal Islands of Adventure. There is a patio you can ask to sit out in the sun!
Went for breakfast. Food was good but the atmosphere is the real attraction. The true Potter fan will be impressed by the attention to detail that was put into this place. It is like being in the movies!
When I go to a theme park, I expect to pay ridiculous prices. That being said, Broomsticks is the only theme park quick service I feel I get my money worth. The food is excellent (have had the fish and chips, chicken and ribs, shepards pie, Cornish pasties and Great Feast). The service for me has always been very friendly and very well themed. Amazing atmosphere for any Harry Potter fan. Your butter beer can easily serve as dessert! Delicious! Unlike quick service at WDW, I have never left hungry.
"The Three Broomsticks is located in the Universal’s Islands of Adventure in The Wizarding World of Harry Potter; it’s just inside Hogsmeade next to Honeydukes. Prices are typical for theme parks and the food is pretty good. Their menu consists with classic English fair such as: Fish and chips, Shepherd's pie, BBQ chicken and Ribs, the ""Great Feast Platter"", Soup, Salads, Desserts, Pumpkin juice and Butterbeer. My son and I each got a Turkey leg and fries and my wife got the Fish and Chips. All was really good. It’s a great place to cool off too; seating is inside. The Three Broomsticks actually joins the Hog’s Head Tavern internally. The decor inside is pretty cool; large wooden benches, stuffed animals and heads on the walls; antlers, high ceiling, etc... Highly recommended. Makes you feel you aren’t a Muggle anymore. I could spend all day just wandering around Hogsmeade and taking everything in. My wife loves the place too.TIP: Don’t wait in the long lines outside for Butterbeer; just head into the Hog’s Head and mosey up to the bar. There’s hardly ever a long line."
As far as food goes, most places outside of a theme park have a better value vs. quality raito. However, as an avid Harry Potter fan, the mediocre food was forgotten almost as fast as I put it in my mouth as I looked around the room in amazement. The bar area is where I spent most of my time, and it is truly an experience. Their specialty brewed beer is far from amazing, but well worth it for the price as opposed to most beverages with the mark-up of a similar setting. Everyone I talked to there was fully in character, and made the visit an absolute blast!!!
"My family and I prepaid for Breakfast at The Three Broomsticks. After our vouchers had been taken and we waited in line to pick up our trays of food, we expected to be pointed towards one of the nice ""reserved"" tables by the windows. (We reserved ahead of time and we were staying at an on-site property. Who else were the tables for?) Instead we were shoved in a tight spot by an unfriendly worker, even though there were plenty of empty tables around us. After we took it upon ourselves to move, we dug into this ""raved about"" meal. I ordered the English Breakfast. First of all, they forgot my black pudding and my mom was given a hard time when she went back to point it out. She really need not have bothered because it wasn't even fried up correctly and was deemed inedible. The grilled tomato was essentially raw. The eggs. I don't even know what those were. They were the worst tasting eggs I have ever had in my life. Not even smothering them in ketchup helped. The meal was just plain awful. It gives English breakfasts everywhere a bad rap.***HOWEVER! My husband and I had been to The Three Broomsticks the previous day. We went in for a rest from the rides. I tried Harry Potter's favorite flavor ice cream, strawberry/peanut butter. Yum! Husband opted for a frozen butterbeer. ***Truly the atmosphere really is fantastic.*** My parents mentioned sitting out on the back patio under the watchful gaze of Hogwarts castle was also very enjoyable. Just avoid the breakfast!P.S. For lunch, try Mythos Restaurant in The Lost Continent area. We ate there twice! Maybe the chef at Mythos can give some pointers to whoever is making the food at The Three Broomsticks!"
"The main reason for this Trip was for my Dad to see ""Harry Potterland."" My Parents had flown in from California just for this reason, as it was a Christmas gift for my Dad. I can say, we spent a good few hours in the area looking at everything. Before my Parents had gotten here, my Mother had done some research and decided that we would have lunch at the Three Broomsticks restaurant to keep with the theme of our Day. I can truly say that all of us were not at all disappointed and were in fact very impressed!!First I would like to say that their Menu is not the ""standard"" Burgers and Chicken Fingers. The food consists of Ribs, Chicken, Sheppard's Pie, Fish and Chips; in all sense of the word, British. There were four of us and in looking at the Menu, we ended up deciding on ""The Great Feast."" This consisted of a HUGE amount of food, said to feed 4 but we all decided it could easily feed 5-6 people with the amount that was brought out. Chicken, Ribs, Corn on the Cob, Roasted Potatoes, Vegetables and a huge Salad was all included in the price of $50. In all honesty, the value was exceptional!Ordering is Cafeteria style but seating was easy as they have people there making sure that everyone gets a place and even though we went around the noon hour, there was not a wait longer than about 10 minutes total from ordering to seating. The atmosphere was Pub style with wooden tables and they had decorations and such that kept with the Harry Potter theme. A note on ordering that I feel should be pointed out. They do not serve Soda here in this Restaurant, if this is a requirement for you then you will be disappointed. They do serve Ice Tea, Lemonade, Water, ButterBeer, Cider and they have their Hog's Head Mead and other Domestic Beers on tap for the adults if you so choose. This place is for any age or any group and if we had the option, we would definitely go there again, if not for just the food but for the atmosphere as well! For a less/not-so-crowed experience, I would suggest going on a week day or eating lunch a little earlier, at about 11am versus going right around noon, although even then it was not overly crowded on a Wednesday.This is a must eat place in my book!!"
Like the rest of the park, totally Harry Potter. We felt like we were living the book or movie!! It was raining and crowded but we didn't wait long to be seated. Servings were generous and the food didn't taste like cafeteria food. Staff was friendly. Very enjoyable meal, added to a fun day!
We ate breakfast here on a Sunday morning. We had a reservation. We got right in without waiting. You order your food and pick it up cafeteria style. Atmosphere is really fun but I wouldn't eat any other meal here besides breakfast. My kids all ordered pancakes and I had the American breakfast. Bacon was very greasy and almost all fat. The kids got sausage and it was very greasy also. The pancakes were fine. You can not get the frozen Butter Beer in the morning.
We arrived at Universal's Wizarding World of Harry Potter early in the morning and ate breakfast after a couple of rides. There were regular kid breakfasts and also UK style breakfasts which my husband and I tried. They were definitely not as good as a real breakfasts we've had in the UK, but it was fun to have something different than what you'd usually get at a theme park. The best parts, however, were the atmosphere and the butterbeer. Be sure to try regular and frozen butterbeer! They're both excellent. The decor was amazing, and it was fun to eat and just look around. Don't miss the room upstairs where you can see a broom sweeping by itself. You can't go up there, but it's fun to see. Be sure to look into the pub too... The kids will love the moving boar's head behind the bar.
The food was not the greatest and everything was very expensive. No place in the restaurant to wash your hands, have to go outside in the park. Just a draft beer was $10. The staff didn't seem to l ike it if you asked them a question. Definitely not a return trip planned.
"OMGosh! If you love Harry Potter even half as much as I do, you need to have a meal here!I'm not sure about breakfast prices (we booked our trip through AAA, so we each got a free breakfast voucher.)All of the staff were nice, helpful and stayed in character. The set up was quick and efficient. Get in line, go to an open register; order and pay.You are then directed to another line to pick up your food. Then, a staff member will direct you to a table. DO NOT get a table before having your food in hand. They will politely remove you, so as to make sure there are enough tables for the patrons. (Wonderful idea! My biggest gripe at Disney was there lax rules about tables; we had to sit on the ground for most our meals at Disney.)There are wonderful ""hidden gems"" all over, so take your time and enjoy the atmosphere.You can see a broom sweeping by itself, a house elf's shadow walk past and an owl's shadow flying, all in the upper level ( which is not accessible to patrons... The main area is open, so you can look up and see everything.)Many breakfast choices, including: pancakes, fruit platter with croissant, ""American"" breakfast and traditional ""English"" breakfast.You can choose from coffee, pumpkin juice and butterbeer for drinks. (Maybe more...that's what we ordered.)All the breakfasts were quite large."
Very enjoyable lunch, great atmosphere and quick service. Food quality was great and portion size was a pleasant surprize. It's a fast food style type service housed in a very cool Harry Potter-style lodge. My family and I quite enjoyed our dining experience. Our servers were patient with our decision-making and guided us to successful choices. $39 for four..pretty good value. Would recommend!! Enjoy.
"First, don't go during usual ""lunch"" times, or else you will wait for a long time and it might be very noisy. When you enter the restaurant, you will have to place and order directly to a casher behind a counter, just like in a fast food. In fact, despite the enchanting Harry Potter architecture, it is pretty much a unusual fast food. When your order is done, you will get to another counter and people will fill your plater with the food you ordered. I ordered a soup and salad combo, and I got a potato & leek soup that was very tasty, and a huge salad with my choice of dressing. To drink, I ordered the ice tea and lemonade mix, and it was a really good choice. You need to take the napkins/knife/forks/spoon/salt/pepper/etc. at another counter and then, you choose your table. My travelling partner also got a salad, but with chicken in it, and we both enjoyed our meals. We took pictures inside the restaurant, and we enjoyed seeing the Harry Potter themed costumes staff members were wearing. Also, take the time to visit the outdoor seating area : it gives you a very nice view of Hogwart's castle."
The setting is great, but the food is awful. Navigating the strange system of hearing about it outside, ordering at a cashier, and then picking up at a (very small and slow) window, I ordered a salad, which turned out to consist of iceberg lettuce, brown and limp. The piscine part of fish and chips was crisp but tasted old, and the chips were droopy. Getting beer for a party including four adults involved an awkward requirement that each diner return to the counter for his or her own drink; this is problematic when you're trying to shepherd children to a table. Macaroni and cheese for the kids was the culinary highlight. That's really hard to ruin. 
The line seems long but it moves pretty fast. Fish & chips were delicious (3 pieces of fish). I recommend eating outside - it is less crowded (not everyone knows that you can eat outside).You can also enjoy views of the park and watch the roller-coasters.
"My husband and I were traveling with our 12-year old, a huge Harry Potter fan. We were eager to spend as much park time as possible in Wizarding World. We looked at the menu and it was a lot like an Irish Pub. She was eager to try the fish and chips so we went in. The menu is a little confusing with a lot of things ""packaged"" together. I wanted something with veggies but we didn't think we could commit to the Feast platter (said to feed four but I saw lots of leftovers on tables.) She ordered the fish and chips, I ordered the Cornish pastries with a salad and a side of steamed veggies. My husband got the half of a roasted chicken. The food was very tasty, fresh and delicious. My husband and I could have split the roast chicken meal. The fish and chips were some of the best I've had anywhere. The batter was light, crispy and not greasy. The pastries were good. The crust was yummy but the filling was a tad dry. The side salad was standard - nothing special. My husband had the house brewed beer (Hogs Head?) and it was very good. They say it's like a Killian's, but I would say it's much better than that. Two pieces of advice...if it's pretty weather - head to the patio. It's relaxing and restful compared to eating inside. And if you want to try the Butter Beer (think buttered rum lifesavers) get it from inside Three Broomsticks, not the cart. Depending on the line, you'll save 15-20 minutes!"
Eating at Three Broomsticks has become part of our Harry Potter tradition. The theming is magical, even when the special shadows are not working (which happens frequently.) We find the staff friendly and caring, service is usually good, the food delicious. We always have pear cider (which is not the same as the bottled variety sold from the Hogsmeade carts) more than once each visit. Our favoirte foods are Cornish pasties and chips. We like the trifle and just last week, discovered the warm, yummy, and very large portion, of apple pie. Whether for a cool drink, a snack, or a meal, we highly recommend the Three Broomsticks.
It looked really busy, but they moved us through the line and found us a table quickly. The food was really good!
For luch we stopped here. It wasn't busy at all and we were a little concerned about the cafeteria style dining. Once inside we saw the feast which was a tray of food. Consisted of corn on cob, ribs, chicken, veggies, salad and potatoes. It was a lot of food we were three adults and one child and we had a hard time finishing the meal. Would do it again for sure.
We were just there for a Butterbeer and the atmosphere. Frozen butterbeer is better than cold, in my opinion. But be sure to specify which you would like when you order as the frozen does cost a bit more than the cold.The restaurant wasn't busy at all when we went inside at 10:30am. They allow you to go in, even if you're just interested in taking pictures. The Host both days we went was a very wonderful gentleman named Jack. In character and well versed on menu items, noting my excitement at seeing a Cornish Pastie on the menu.You could even get a real beer at the Hogshead. But only 1 per ID.This place LOOKS AMAZING! We were blown away by the detail put into this place. We were seated in a corner booth near a window and some stairs. Listen carefully if you are seated there, you might hear a house elf!
"We went to Three Broomsticks for an early lunch the first day at Wizarding World and had shepherd's pie, fish and chips, butterbeer, and pumpkin juice. There is an outdoor porch for dining with a spectacular forced-perspective view of Hogwarts. I hope it goes without saying that my rating for a restaurant goes part-in-parcel with what I expect. A pretzel stand might get a ""very good"" as easily as a five-star restaurant, just so long as it has very good pretzels. Three broomsticks is a very good order at the cashier, cafeteria style, carry-your-food-on-a-tray and seat yourself joint. The shepherd's pie was so good that I gave it to my son to try and, before I knew it, he had eaten the whole thing. I was saving calories for dessert anyway.I would have given Three Broomsticks an Excellent if they had had all the foods from the movies: treacle tart, dessert puddings, etc. For breakfast they did have an English breakfast meal with black pudding but I wanted more authentic Hogwarts fare."
OK food, but A+ efficiency.I was really impressed by how this restaurant handled the large crowd. First, we had to wait to be assigned to a counter to pay the lunch. While waiting, we had a chance to review the menu and make up our mind. Because of this extra step, the ordering station area wasn't busy. Once we ordered and paid, we were assigned to another counter to pick up our food. Once we stepped into the dinning hall with our food, we were directed to an empty table because they knew how many we were and when we came. While we were eating, we observed the restaurant workers cleaned up the vacant tables fast. If there weren't tables to clean, they walked around and took away empty trays and dishes from the occupied table. I really liked it: navigating through a large crowd in the park, I really appreciated that I had a moment that was stressless and painless and could enjoy my meal in peace.We ordered Cornish pasties, roasted chicken and shepherd pie. The chicken was so so. Cornish pasties and shepherd pie were good. So were pumpkin juice and butter beer. The overall experience was good.
I was worried, initially, due to having to line-up just to get inside the restaurant. There was also a line inside the restaurant, winding around to the counter area, where we ordered the feast for 4. But we were pleasantly surprised by the service and quality of food. Moist chicken, and ribs with meat that fell right off the bones... and the waiters were friendly and courteous as well. The decorum was fun and magical too. Would definitely eat here again, if only we didn't need to pay theme park admission to do so.
Please don't miss this as it is a once in a lifetime experience. Since the Wizarding World of Harry Potter opened, we were very excited to immerse ourselves in the total HP experience. We planned out our day around lunch at the three broomsticks. A word of advice, get the platter for 4. There is a nominal charge for adding another person. As you walk in you will be asked to place your order with the casher and pay for your meal. It is a short walk over to the pick-up counter where you receive your drinks and salad. I would agree with other reviews in that the frozen butter beer is to die for.A waitress will bring out the main course/meal to the table. This family meal consisted of Fresh Corn on the Cob; Pan Fried Potatoes, Steamed Carrots and Broccoli, Baked Whole Chicken (quartered) and 4-Bone Barbequed Pork Ribs. This meal was more than enough to feed our family of 5 and was a fairly healthy meal considering we were at a theme park. Believe me you will have no room for desert after eating this big meal. The total cost for lunch was about $104.00 USD for the 5 of us which included the frozen butter beers in a nice reusable souvenir mug. Again, not too bad considering you’re at a theme park. Don’t forget to show your AAA card as they do offer discounts.I was pleasantly surprised with the high quality of the food and would highly recommend the 3 broom sticks to all. This is an experience not to be missed. 
This is a nicely done restaurant that fits the Wizarding World theme exceedingly well. The food was surprisingly good for a theme park lunch. The interior matches the WWoHP themes and adds to the entire experience. The menu in the line is a display of the various plates and platters in a window box - nice. The problem is that the children's choices are nowhere to be found until you get to the head of the line and are rushed to place your order. As has been noted before it’s a wait in line to place your order, get in another line to wait for your order, then wait in line to get a table. Yes it's all plastic plates, utensils, etc. and you have to bus your own table. Somehow eating at a place that is supposed to be just outside a children's boarding school (even if it is a magical one) I found all that in keeping with the theme/setting. The 1/4 chicken was cooked well and seasoned with a light hand. The skin was nicely browned and crisp and the meat was moist and properly cooked. No more pricey than any other sit-down theme park meal and much better than most of them I have had in the past. The butterbeer is a real treat and it was much easier to get than waiting in line outside.
We had a breakfast reservation at Three Broomsticks. First you have to order the food and pay in one line then pick the food in another line. Then, the attendant helps you find a table. But we were so overwhelmed by the atmosphere, the wait in the lines did not bother us. I had read a lot of negative reviews about the bad food and small quantities. But to our surprise the food was great and portions were large. No one in our group could finish their entire platter. We got the non frozen butterbeer. It was so tasty, we couldn’t get enough of it. I am glad we made the decision to eat at Three Broomsticks.
There are lineups everywhere in the Wizarding World and this was no exception. We ordered the platter for four; corn on the cob, ribs, chicken, vegetables, salad. We enjoyed the meal. You stand in line, order, pay, get a table number. Pick up your salad and drinks. Stand in line to be seated. Your good is brought to your table. 
We went twice - once for breakfast and once for butter beer only. Food is edible but not great. Butter beer is fantastic, and combined with the interior design, worth a stop.
The breakfast here was above average. The Traditional English Breakfast was good and had generous amounts of food. The sausage was a bit greasy, but the croissant was good. We opted to try lunch here later during our three days at the park, that turned out to be not such a good idea. The lunch was pretty bland, a bit overpriced, and nothing special. What makes eating here worth it is the ambiance and atmosphere. The decor on the inside fits in great with the Harry Potter / Hogsmeade theme well. The butterbeer was good, and it seemed there was less of a wait to get it here than at one of the butterbeer wagons in the park. Overall it might be worth it to try some breakfast to enjoy the ambiance, but don't expect to be blown away.
We spent six days at Disney and only one at Universal. We had LOADS of theme park food, most to our determent. I was REALLY pleased with the Three Broomsticks. Originally I had suggested to my wife that we leave the park and eat at Margaritaville, right outside,then come back in. She suggested that since we'd come to see the Harry Potter ride, we should at least have one meal in that section of the park. I was really glad that we did. The place looked really nice, fit into the theme. And the food was really good, relatively healthy, and very reasonably priced. We split two lunches. One consisted of a half of a roasted chicken, a roasted ear of corn and some roasted potato chunks, for $11. The second was some cornish pastries and a large salad for $8. Both really surprised me by how good they were. In keeping with the theme, the primary drinks served were pumpkin juice and butter beer. No soft drinks. We opted for water, but later tried both and both were really good as well. I was just extremely pleased with the experience.
There was a complimentary continental breakfast at the hotel, but my kid made me go to the Three Broomsticks for breakfast four days in a row, so I sampled a different breakfast platter each day: the traditional English, the smoked salmon, the American and the continental breakfasts. The crowds were not there, so we did not have to wait to be seated. The food is quite good for a fast-food restaurant. The ambiance is great. You'll feel as if you were in a Harry Potter movie ... until you step outside.
"Not satisfied at all - not with the food, the service, the ambiance, the lack of attention when we mentioned things wrong to the manager. We ordered the platter for four for $49.99 and our food came out lukewarm. When we placed our order, there was no mention of any beverages and we were not offered any. We had to get our own water. You carry your own trays, eat on plastic plates and utensils, serve yourself off a platter and then bus your own table. They were emptying the garbage right beside us and fumes coming from the trash were disguisting. We complained to management and nothing became of it. Finally my husband had to move the garbage can! They advertise their restaurant as ""a fine dining experience"" and this obviuously was a joke! It was less than dining at McDonalds except for the price. Not satisfied, will not recommend and will not ever eat there again."
We had a reserved booking for breakfast here as part of our Universal hotel and park package. We had read that it could be busy and difficult to get a table here. But when we arrived for our 10am bf reservation, the place was visibly empty. We could choose anything on the breakfast menu plus a drink. Even my 6yo daughter. She does not have to pick from a kids menu. The only difference is they give her a smaller portion which is great.Among us we had the pancakes, American breakfast and English breakfast. All good. I tried the pumpkin juice for the fun of it but none of us like it. It has a wired cinnamon taste. We had wanted to try butter beer here, but it is not served during bf. We ended up buying butter beer from the various kiosk. I like the regular butter beer but my younger son likes the frozen one. The rest of the family were indifferent.The overall deco and theming of his place is fantastic! It really invoke memory of the book or movie. Very nicely done like the rest of Wizarding World of Harry Potter.A great place to eat to complete the Harry Potter experience.
We loved the overall atmosphere of the Harry Potter section of IoA but the food at the Three Broomsticks was just awful. Maybe I made a mistake in my order - but I was sort of hoping for a real English Pasty. What we got was... well not that! It tasted more like a sort of dry Bolognese sauce in pastry. Not good at all - and of course pretty expensive too.
"The ""Great Feast Platter"" is ""Great"". They say it feeds 4, but it really feeds 5 Adults easily. The Ribs, Chicken, corn on the cob, and vegetables each have their own distinct outstanding flavor. "
The atmosphere was cool but the food wasn't. The shepard's pie was bland with hardly any taste. Whole Food's sells better frozen Shepard's pie. The turkey leg was dry.
The fish and chips were really good. I would definitely get those again and again. Can't say the same for the Cornish pasties. They are small and too carroty-- kinda strange flavor. The butter beer is fun. My kids loved it. I thought it was a little too rich.
I highly recommend spilling your butterbeer onto your pancakes. No, this isn’t a euphemism. Let me explain…first, I am not much of a pancake fan, but the pancakes here are wonderful – light, super-fluffy and not doughy at all. The sausages that they serve with them are delicious and do remind me of the sausages I ate when I lived in the UK. Univeral’s Butterbeer is a delicious interpretation of the Harry Potter beverage, and when you order a pancake breakfast you can choose butterbeer as your beverage which is what my children did, being loyal Harry Potter fans. Then my husband accidentally spilled one of the butterbeers across an entire plate of pancakes as he was getting napkins. My daughter volunteered my son to eat the soaked pancakes, which he loved! It turned out to be so good that we returned the next day to order pancakes again and this time intentionally poured the butterbeer onto the pancakes instead of syrup. Delicious! 
I remember that the food was surprisingly good, with large portions. But it's drowned out in my memory by the Butterbeer, which dominates my memory of the park!Like other attractions, Universal manages the queue, sometimes sending you just inside a door that seems like a short line, but when you get inside wraps around out of view. However it does move along fairly well. The ordering process is quite quirky, with orders placed at register islands and then you wait for your number to be called out at the bar, where they fill your trays with your food orders and Butterbeer. It's rather chaotic but eventually fulfilled. The dining hall is nicely decorated but we chose the patio with beautiful views outside.When we finished our meal, and our first round of Frozen Butterbeer, we found ourselves wanting another round of the foamy stuff. Thankfully there is a dedicated bar at the back of the restaurant for alcohol, but most people just wanted Butterbeer. There was a fast moving line here, so we could walk out and continue our exploration in frosty bliss.
Try the frozen butterbeer!The shepards pie is amazing and delicious.Quick service but very quirky service and atmosphere. It was right out of the books/movies.We loved it!
The offering of a platter for four was our choice for lunch. Chicken, ribs, potatoes, vegetables and bread was ample for our party. Add the delicious butter beer and we had a superb meal. The restaurant was very busy yet the service very expedient and friendly. 
My expectations of theme park restaurants are high on atmosphere, high on price, low on edibility. While the first two bore out for Three Broomsticks, I was pleasantly surprised by the food. The roasted chicken was tender and flavorful. It came with real corn on the cob, not the frozen kind. The potatoes were perfectly done! (We expected them to have been sitting around a while for the lunchtime crowd.) The shepherd's pie was well seasoned with a good balance between meat, veggie and mash. The side salad was unimaginatively average and I would avoid the overpriced tired-looking fish 'n' chips. But don't pass up the rich, creamy butterbeer.
I wasn't expecting much from a theme park restaurant, but the Three Broomsticks impressed me with it's varied menu and good food. I also liked that they find you a table and you're not left to wander the dining room while balancing your food trays. I'm sue it helped that I went on a low attendance day. The prices are typical of amusement parks. 
I can understand everyone wanting to go in here and sure it makes you feel like you are in the film, the chattering echos through the building in authentic Hogwarts style.It's very overpriced, i ordered fish and chips which looked very nice, the batter looked crisp and golden when i took a bite it was spongey, thick and disgusting and the previously frozen fish was bland and tasteless, i left the whole plate, i was so hungry i would have pretty much eaten anything but it was THAT bad. I'm a big Universal fan and been there many times, why can't they make a decent bit of fish and chips when they can put together world class attractions and themes. I have had the breakfast too, horrible little chipolatas and dry lank pancakes. Don't waste your money, go in and buy a Butterbeer...the frozen one..which is delicious but don't part with your hard earned cash on this 'food'.....muggles we may be but mugs we are not
The look for this place was spot on. I felt like we were in the movie! The food? AWFUL and exspensive.
The breakfast here was tasty and filling. My children loved watching the boar above the bar come to life every few minutes! It was fun to check out all the decor and the view from the back of the restaurant was beautiful! My family loved the Butterbeer drink! 
I love 3 brooms! The food and atmosphere are amazing. Cornish pasties are my favorite food and of course frozen butterbeer for a drink. If you get dessert, the ice cream comes in Florean Fortescue's branded tubs! I love the housefly projections on the walls too...
We liked this restaurant aside from being huge Harry Potter fans the food was good. The atmosphere was great and you got a lot of food for the money. I loved the frozen Butterbeer and I could order it with my meal. Different selection which was a nice switch from the usual park food. The attendents set us up at a table which was great no hunting for together tables for our party of 9...loved the big round table that we did not see in any other restaurant we visited during our 4 days at the parks.
Getting breakfast out of the way is critical for hitting the parks hard first thing in the morning. In the Universal resort, it's not that easy since many places aren't open early and the dining choices are limited and expensive.Three Broomsticks offers a pretty authentic British breakfast until 10.30am for about $12, which includes a drink. The full English consists of eggs, bacon, black pudding, baked beads, croissant and potatoes and it's a hearty meal. My only gripe is the lack of HP brown sauce which would have sealed the deal. Did I mention how hard it is to find black pudding when you're a Brit living in the States? Seriously, it's the first time I've seen it in 10 years.From an ordering point of the view, this is more of a factory than fine dining experience, which may explain how some visitors get confused. You order, you pay, you pick up, you sit down, you eat - trying to do this in any other order will lead to unhappiness. The folks working here are pretty efficient and relatively happy considering how dreadful the jobs must be (yes, they still have to call you muggles and pretend they're in Hogsmeade while clearing the tables and pouring the slop into buckets).Food aside, the decor is pretty neat and faithful to the Harry Potter universe. Kids and HP fans will definitely get a kick out of it.
We had a great lunch at this restaurant. On a very busy day we decided to duck in here for an early lunch for our family of four. The ordering process is a bit odd with all the different counters. I understand why they try and seat you as it is frustrating trying to find a place to sit if you let smaller parties occupy larger tables. Reserved signs are on the bigger tables for a reason.We went for the Great Feast and it did not disappoint. The food was tasty as expected and the right temperature. The chicken and ribs were delicious, veggies and potatoes cooked thoroughly and the corn on the cob very filling. No real complaints, but we left some food behind as it was quite a meal. Drinks of course had to be butter beer! We split frozen and non-frozen souvenir cups to take back home with us.Atmosphere and theme was nice and felt like I was right smack in the middle of something special. Kids explored around and enjoyed finding hidden treasures abound. AC was pumping so it did get a bit chilly inside on this hot day. Host and staff were friendly. Facility was clean and staff attentive to cleaning up as parties left. We certainly did not expect a five-star experience but it certainly met our expectations and I would return again on future visits.
The atmosphere and the staffs are true to the movie. When I signed for the credit card receipt, the cashier handed me a feather pen. One thing to note, my sister ordered the turkey leg and it was so salty. The rest of us ordered roasted chicken and a salad. The foods are ok, nothing to write home about. But this fast food restaurant has the longest line in the Island of Adventure, and tables are lmited.
The restaurant was a great visual experience and it was easy to imagine that you were part of the Hogwarts community. The food that we had - the family platter for 4- was just ok. The portions were fine but the food was a bit undercooked and not all that flavourful- the corn seemed like it was not even cooked. Be aware that the ordering system is complicated with an order line, a payment line, a pick-up line and then a seating line- they will not let you be seated until you have your food. Overall, great experience for young Harry Potter fans with meiocre food.
"This place was terrible. We had a free breakfast deal and still found that we felt cheated. The line setup is confusing. There were several groups who ended up on the wrong line, only to finally find out after fifteen minutes waiting that we had to start the process over. (The hostess said ""Go over there to line 2 to order."" and point pointed vaguely. We did. Ended up it was the food pickup line and because of this had to get back on the other line 2....the one you coudn't see from the hostess stand.)The food was cold, stale, tasteless, and gross. Yes, gross. We threw out most of it. And we are not that picky. I am not aure how they justify this place. It was that bad."
I was impressed with the atmosphere in this eating establishment, very true to the Harry Potter story. The food was Good also, I had the shepard's pie along with a Butterbeer. I had been thinking about the Butterbeer since first booking the trip to FL and was not disappointed. Sure it was sweet but also creamy and delicious.
After a long awaited visit to Harry Potter world we thought it would be nice to eat in a themed restaurant having purposely missed breakfast. Excited by the sight of the billboard advertising full English breakfast we paid $45 for 2 adults and a child, which included drinks. The sausages were good although very small. This did not resemble an English breakfast. There was cheesy croissant, scrambled eggs, grilled tomato sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, raw meat in the shape of bacon and what they had done to the black pudding know one knows. I didn't think that it was possible to mess up baked beans, but again now I know different. I cannot believe that they are passing this off to people from all corners of the earth as English food. What must people think!!!It's worthy of note that we received three plates full of this rubbish and with the exception of the sausages there was almost three plates of the same rubbish left on the table as we left. I don't know what they must do with the food left by customers because surely there can't be any animals hungry enough to eat it. I assume that there is a large pile of it somewhere ready for landfill. After 22 years with my husband I have seen him eat some of the most disgusting dishes and I thought that there was no limit to how low his food standards would go. I now know different.
We were generally really impressed with the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and had planned to have lunch here on our day in Islands of Adventure.The queue wasn't as long as it looks like it might get (late September) and we placed our order within a couple of minutes. There was a slightly longer wait at the counter where you get your food as the customer in front of me had changed her mind on something.I had the fish and chips, the fish was really good, freshly cooked in crispy batter, the chips were potato wedges that had lost their crunch. My wife had the roast chicken which was good and came with corn on the cob and plenty of butter.I also had the Butterbeer (the cold one not the frozen one), but wasn't that big a fan of it.The atmosphere and the decor were really impressive, according to the Harry Potter Wikia it was designed before the film set, and the film set was based on it, not vice versa! If it's not too hot then you can sit out on the terrace with a good view of Hogwarts and the lake.
We arrived at this restaurant due to a rather large down pour of rain, on arriving wet we were initially dissapointed by how cold it was in the building as when your already cold and wet the last thing you want is to be in an even colder place but putting this aside we had a look at the menu - very good choices but we only wanted a snack so we went for the chicken salad. This is where the confusing bit as a britain comes in, you order your food and pay in one queue, you are then moved onto another queue where you collect your food, your then moved into another queue to collect cutlery, sauces and napkins and when i thought there can be no more queues you were ushered into another queue for a table ... which there was a wait for .. now what i did not understand is why they were serving food if there were no tables as most of what was on the menu was hot food .. regardless we were eventually found a seat. Seated we tucked into our Chicken salad with bread rolls and it was delicious .. the chicken was moist and tasty and there was LOADS of salad .. the apple cider is in fact apple juice but is tasty all the same .. over all a very nice lunch and would return again :) Each of the staff are dressed in atire and it is as you would expect for the three broomsticks, alot to look at and alot of fun to be had if your a die hard potter fan!!
The atmosphere in this restaurant is fantastic. Be on the lookout for magic all around. The costumes for their team members are pitch perfect. It really transports you to another place. The food is nothing to really write home about and the side salads are enough to be an entree salad. I've eaten there 3 different times having 3 different entrees. The fish and chips were probably the best, the Cornish Pasties were middle of the road and the leek and potato soup was under seasoned. Here you can also buy butterbeer, ciders, and pumpkin juice. I enjoyed the choice of different types of beverages inside the land. Outside Wizarding World the park has Coke products but inside they only have drinks that you would find in the books. Very cool detail. The atmosphere and staff make up for the not completely fantastic food. And remember your AAA card for the AAA spell because it will save you 10% off everything in the park no minimum purchase.
"Any fan of the Harry potter movies would probably have nothing bad to say about this place and for good reason. The place looks and feels just like what you see in the movies or have read in the books.Food and drink wise i would say the place was just ok. Serving ""traditional"" British dishes that leave something to be desired. I do understand that this place gets very busy on a daily basis due to all the crowds so i get the fact that most go just for the experience.The ordering system is a bit like something you would see in a fast food restaurant but the staff are helpful and polite. price wise it's a bit expensive for what you get but overall a good atmosphere and great place for any happy potter fanatic."
We were seriously impressed with WWOHP at IOA so decided to have lunch at the 3 Broomsticks.You order food and drinks in a slightly different way to how you do at home. Upon entering the pub you place your order at a row of cashiers, move to a different line to collect your food and drink, move to a large dresser to collect your cutlery and condiments and then find a table.The portions aren't huge but are the ideal size for lunch time. The food isn't brilliant but the excellent surroundings and atmosphere more than compensate for this. The shepherd's pie was nice, if not a little salty and the cornish pasties were yummy but resembled empanadas. We opted for Hogshead Brew at $6.75 a pint which quenched our thirst. I opted for a Butter Beer. I didn't fancy it at first after reading descriptions of it tasting like cream soda, which I hate. However, curiosity got the better of me and I went for it. I'm so glad I did - it was a glass of creamy gorgeousness. Even if you aren't a fan of the Harry Potter movies, which I'm not, you just have to visit this place if you are at IOA.
We went into The Three Broomsticks not knowing what to expect. They had a bar where they served Butterbeer and Pumpkin juice and an eating area. The Butterbeer and Pumpkin juice were delicious! The food from the restaurant was acceptable and they have an interesting ordering system set up. The eating area is quaint with the theme music playing in the background.
We booked a breakfast here ahead of time because they fill up rather quickly. This was a smart option to take since we were able to walk right in instead of waiting to be seated. There are several good breakfast options and we definitely ate until we were full. The restaurant is much larger than the one in the books and movies, but they did a very good job decorating. I would do it again.
As others have said - the themeing here is fantastic! We shared the fish & chips and a frozen butterbeer - both were very good! Butterbeer has sort of a cream soda flavor. This is counter service - we were there at about 2PM - ordered and had our food in about 5 minutes. Other diners seemed happy - everything looked yummy and smelled amazing!
So the decor gets a five. Everything in this area was top notch and put me in the Harry Potter/Hogsmeade world. The food was just okay though. Certainly solid but I kind of wish it was up to the standards set by the Mythos restaurant. 
If any of your family loves Harry Potter, your trip to Universal Studios's Hogsmeade is a must. While staying on the NE coast of Florida, we made a daytrip to Orlando, mainly to have lunch at the Three Broomsticks, to browse the shops and for my teen daughter to do the rides last week. We were able to walk right in, and get all our favorites- Cornish pasties, chips and pear cider. Buy a souvenir mug, and enjoy refills at low prices, not just here, but anywhere in Universal. We have tried most of the other menu items and like everything but the aftertaste of Butterbeer. Some of the shops had new Harry merchandise; the big shop at the entry gate of Islands of Adventure has doubled the Harry merchandise since our last visit lin Jan.
This was my two granddaughters choice, I was ok for the rest of us my two grandsons and two daughters. The pancakes were nice and fluffy.
Amazing atmosphere in Harry Potter world and eating here is unbelivable! Had ribs and the chicken platter on second visit and both were great.TIPS* Try frozen and original Butterbeer and share they both are amazing* Look above you at the scenary it's awesome.* Share a strawberry and Peanut butter ice cream for dessert (no where else makes them) but get it AFTER because it will melt whilst eating.* Go outside after for a beautiful view of rear Hogwarts.* Go later at night, we had a butterbeer at around 7:30-8:00 and was one of my favourite memories ever with my girlfriend.
I love eating here! It is always a must when we go to the park. It is so much food for the price I believe it is well worth it. Plus the decor is what makes it. I always get the quarter chicken and my fiance gets the turkey leg and we just sit down for a good meal. I am obsessed with anything pumpkin.Their pumpkin fizz drink is by far one of my favorite drinks. I wish it was available more places. I have yet to go for breakfast but if you eat lunch or dinner here make sure you come hungry!
The food isn't much better than standard theme park fare, but the detail of the restaurant is well worth a visit. You can also buy butter beer here and the lines are usually shorter than the outdoor butterbeer stands
As a massive HP fan, we had no option but to eat here. The food was surprisingly good and good value. Corn on the cob was awesome - inc stalk! Good choice of food options and staff friendly. The only downside was by the time we go to our table the potatoes and corn were a little cold - but that's the price you pay quick service style. However, there was no need to wonder looking for a table as the staff did this for you - nice touch! I just love the fact that I ate there - sadly excitment took over, and we forgot to take any photos until we went to leave (whoops).
In the heart of Harry Potter land at Universal we had lunch here which was really good. The fish and chips and shepards pie were really tasty. The prices weren't crazy. It was well worth it. We also had our butterbeers. Quite delicious.
"Because my daughter is a HP fanatic, we were obliged to dine there regardless of cost! I was relieved. In comparison to other amusement parks, the price was extremely reasonable. In fact, it compared favorably with outside restaurants. I purchased ButterBeer in souvenir mugs for my children, which added $20 to the bill (an expensive indulgence). I had the pumpkin juice for the experience. We ordered the feast for 4 at $50, which at first seems pricey. When the platter came, with salad, vegetables, potatoes, roasted corn on the cob, 1/2 slab of ribs, and roasted chicken, we were pleasantly surprised. There was so much food that we all ""ate too much."" My 15 year old son was actually ""filled up,"" which any parent of a 15 year old boy knows is hard to accomplish!!!"
We ate here twice during our visit to the parks because we're such HP fans. The first time was a bit pricey because we purchased 3 butterbeers in souvenir mugs along with our meals. My son got the rib platter and loved it, especially the potatoes. My mom and I shared the chicken and rib platter and it was enough to feed the both of us. I liked the ribs, Mom liked the corn the most. On our next visit (just me and my son), I got the pasties and salad, and my son got the fish and chips. I liked the pasties, kinda like an empanada, the meat tasted like it was seasoned with celery, very tasty. The salad was just a normal bit of lettuce and tomato. My son ate every bit of his fish and chips, wanted more. As for drinks the second time around we went for pumpkin juice and Hog's Head Brew, loved them both much more than the butterbeer! Be advised, you cannot get soda here so if you love your Coke as much as I do, get a refill before going into WWOHP. Prices were very reasonable. Expected to pay much more being that is was in WWOHP. The decor was just like in the movies and we enjoyed every minute of it!!!
Lots of food for the money, and you don't spend much money either.....3 people ate for around 50$, only 20$ was for 2 butterbeers, so all in all 3 entrees and drinks for about 30$. I got a grilled chicken salad that was really good, so much I couldn't finish it. Hubby got a smoked turkey leg and 2 sides, and he couldn't finish it. Our 16 year old son couldn't finish his chicken fingers and fries....you really get a lot....next time we go, i am going to snack off their plates so we don't waste food...lol
The food was tasty and not so badly priced considering the theme park mark up. Not especially Harry Potter-esque there are a few animatronic things on the walls, but there is so much cafeteria bustle you'll probably forget to look.
We had lunch at the Three Broomsticks on a recent visit to Wizarding World of Harry Potter. We chose the restaurant solely because it was the Three Broomsticks, and were happy with the food choices.Lunch fare was a bit better than the typical overpriced fast food burger places-we had overpriced ribs/chicken and fish. Our 18 year old vegetarian daughter was allowed to order mac and cheese off of the kids' menu (not a lot of choices for vegetarians) and was given a complimentary butterbeer when she had to wait a few minutes for her food.Overall, the food was better than expected; service was good and the restaurant was fun! If you aren't a Harry Potter fan, it might not be worth it to visit, but Harry Potter fans will probably enjoy the experience.
To complete the Harry Potter experience for our daughter we decided to eat at the 3 Broomsticks. First impression it reminded me of a canteen style set up, but the surroundings are very Harry Potter and impressive. Queue wasnt too bad and moved quickly. We ordered the family platter about 50 dollars, was given the salad and drinks along with a number and told the food would be delivered to us. I must admit I didnt think that we would be found a table, but we were immediately shown to to clean table. The waiters were very pleasant and helpful. The salad had a vinegarette dressing and the platter came with 4 pieces of chicken, 4 corn on the cobs, 4 spare ribs, broccoli, carrots and potatoes. There was plenty for the 4 of us, and I was very surprised at the quality and quantity considering it was in a theme park. I thought the price was reasonable for what we got. The face on my daughter though was priceless. 
I liked the potatoes, but we didn't get seated in the main dining room. It was packed so we got the last table in the bar, not nearly the atmosphere we wanted. Still, it was air conditioned! Next time I would just get one Butter Beer to share, the kids took about two sips and wanted water. The kids meals were a good deal and they let me order one.
Totally shocked at the fantastic value for money, level of service and quality of food during our visit to the three broomsticks at Universal's islands of adventure. 6 people well fed and watered, the 'great feast' is a must have -easily feeds 4 or 5 people!
A fun place with some good choices; fish & chips, salads, chicken etc. Go in to get your butter bear or pumpkin juice, the lines are shorter than in the street. Expensive though.
There's 4 or 5 breakfasts to choose from, so something for everyone. Really big inside so loud but that's good for me because my little one gets loud too. incredible. We would eat here again if returning to this park but honestly there is only 1 true coaster in each park (only motion movie type rides) so we will stick with the Disney parks in the future
We booked the Harry Potter package that included the breakfast. From my calculation, the breakfast was about 17$ per adult. The ambiance in the restaurant is really good, but the food left a lot to be desired. My daughter could not eat her eggs and said that they tasted funny. The pancakes were average, but nothing great. This is pretty much fast food for the price you are paying. If you go for your Harry Potter fans, it is great, if not, move on to another restaurant.
it was very crowded and alittle confusing to order. the atmosphere was great and the food ended up being pretty good! fish and chips and pumpkin juice are my recommendation.
The Three Broomsticks was excellent compared to the other counter-service restaurants at Universal Orlando. The line for dinner was surprisingly not very long. I think we were seated in Hogshead Tavern. The eating area did not seem overly clean, but that seemed in keeping with many of the Harry Potter movie sets. Worker chased a pigeon out of the restaurant. The shepherds pie was good, though not being British, I cannot vouch for its authenticity. The fish and chips were also good. This location is not on the 2012 Universal Dining plan (which we did not waste money on), but it was the culinary high point of our 3 days at Universal.
We had breakfast here, very disappointing $49 + tax for three people and the food was just woeful it just does not help when you wait for a table after getting your food, staff good but the breakfast experience you can do without.
cornish pasties - eh, but interestingfish & chips - good (nice: comes with grapes!)turkey leg - very goodbutter beer regular - good (walked back up universal to buy a second)butter beer frozen - not goodpumpkin juice - keep your moneycorn on the cob - goodNote: a turkey leg, corn on the cob and frozen butter beer (no takeaway mug) is $20! A bit pricey for my taste, even though the turkey leg was exceptional.Btw, you can only sit inside if you are ordering food. Otherwise they will make you sit on the patio (read: no A/C) outback.
We ate lunch at The Three Broomsticks on July 4th, and needless to say, we thought the food was good and the experience was fantastic. I had the Shepherd's Pie, while my wife had the Rotisserie Chicken, and my sister in law had Rotisserie Chicken Salad and three butter beers. The chicken was very good and the pie was good as well.A word of advice, after talking with several staff members, try to eat lunch super early, around 10:00 to 10:15...each person indicated the food was better at the start of service. Also, try the frozen butter beer, it is delicious!
We were welcomed at the door and then had to queue to order, which isn't bad seeing as we knew the restaurant was popular. Staff were polite and provided a good service. Although the amount of indoor seating is lacking, which meant we had to wait to be allocated a table letting our food get cold.We paid $69.00 for five meals and two 'butterbeers'. x3 Fish and chips; x1 Cornish pasties; and the Chicken Plater.The fish and chips were ok, the fish was cod and you recieved three pieces however the chips were only potato wedges. The chicken plater wasn't to my sister's liking, the smokey flavour was over powering.The best meal was the cheapest the Cornish Pasties which were accompanied by a salad with a dressing of your choice.All in all, we were disappointed after all the praise this restaurant has recieved on TA..
If we would not have gotten this breakfast complimentary through our AAA reservatuons, I would have been one VERY unhappy patron.The breakfast was not very good: fresh fruit - ok; pancakes - average; eggs and potatoes - horrible.The service area is chaotic to say the least - my wife had a worker bump into her and she ended up wearing her breakfast.The best part was when they cleared the table for us and we exited the building. We will not be back!
We stopped in on one of the rainy chilly days we were there. The food was tasty, warm and, of course, the butterbeers were delicious! The beauty of grabbing butterbeers in there is that our 15% discount worked in there but not at the carts! :)
Breakfast was pretty good. Be sure to make reservations or you will have a long wait for a table. 
We recently visited the WWOHP and enjoyed lunch at The Three Broomsticks. We normally do the Meal Deal when visiting Universal but decided we needed to experience all of WWOHP. We were not dissapointed! Altho a bit on the pricey side, you definitely get your moneys worth. I had the shepherds pie and it was great! My boy had chicken strips. The atmosphere is so great! You feel like JK Rowling personally built this place from the pages of HP. There is so much to see that you may take awhile eating your food. After you are done eating swing by the bar (Hogshead is attached to restaurant) to watch and hear the Hogs Head on the wall behind the bartender.
Loved the traditional English breakfast so much we came back for lunch! In keeping with the Harry Potter theme, the menu items were traditional English choices with fun drink options like Butter Beer and Pumpkin juice. Great place to eat, drink and rest while at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter!
Amazing theming and good food. Be sure to try the butterbeer, but use a straw.
This was not typical park fare food, MUCH better! A great deal of variety, reasonable prices for an amusement park, and a very interesting atmosphere. Do try the butterbeer here (we prefered the frozen...but try both) and pumpkin juice. My grandkids loved it!
We enjoyed lunch during our day at the park. Very crowded but the lines moved faster than expected. Seating is somewhat difficult but overall works out pretty well. A little pricey but expected at a theme park. This is a congested area, I would avoid going with children in strollers.
I have eaten at the Three Broomsticks two times. I enjoyed it both times. The first time I went it was pouring down rain outside, so of course the line was long. The second time, it was bright and sunny, but around lunch, so of course the line was also long. However, the lines move very fast, and it gives you an opportunity to look around at all the details they put into it. I, being a Potter fanatic was fascinated by the atmosphere, and architecture. The food is good, with a reasonable price. The first time I had a turkey leg with french fries and Butter Beer. The second time, I had Shepard's Pie with the salad and Pumpkin Juice. Both were very tasty. If you are a die hard Harry Potter fan, I would suggest this restaurant. It is a very neat dining experience.
We had lots of fun eating lunch at the Three Broomsticks. We had come to Universal Islands of Adventure specifically to see the Harry Potter attractions and planned in advance to have an early lunch here. Having read some reviews we listened to the advice and arrived at the restaurant at a few minutes before noon. At that time we were the only ones in line and only a few of the tables in the huge restaurant were occupied so we had our choice of spots. Lots of people come into the restaurant just to take pictures and that is a little annoying but I guess understandable as we wanted to do the same. We sat by the huge fireplace along the back wall. It is well themed.We all ordered the chicken dinner and the portion was very generous and the price reasonable. We chose the frozen butterbeer (we had tried the regular and were not impressed) and we loved it. None of us tried the pumpkin juice. There was a line as we exited the restaurant about a half hour later and the tables were starting to fill but there was still plenty of room. By now the crowds in the Harry Potter section of the park had doubled! And many, many people were heading into the restaurant. So eating early is good advice!
We had tried both breakfast and lunch at the Three Broomsticks during our recent visit to Island of Adventure.Breakfast: Approximately $15/p, we have ordered the one that has everything for breakfast. Taste alright, nothing extraordinary. Breakfast came with a drink, we ordered butter beer. The staff mentioned that during breakfast time, there is no frozen version of butter beer available at the restaurant.Lunch: My hubby tried the chicken, he said it was ok. I tried the turkey leg meal.....taste alright, I think it might be the same turkey leg you can buy from a cart within the park. My son and I together was only able to finish about half of the turkey leg...it is HUGE....I will upload some pics later....I would want to try out the Fish and CHips next time when I visit IOA again.We have tried some sort of pumkin drink, did not quite like it. We love the frozen butter beer...I can drink it every day if they sell it outside of IOA. :*)Staffs were friendly! They don't normally allow strollers inside the restaurant but my son was falling asleep inside the stroller while we entered the restaurant. The nice gentleman/staff allowed us in with a stroller so my son can continue to sleep.This restaurant completes our experience at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, would recommend to at least try it once.
"This is not just a place to eat but also one of the Harry Potter attractions. Its a place where you can enjoy the food and look around and see all the details considered in designing and decorating this restaurant. It is an important part of the show, and any visit to this attraction would be incomplete without visiting The Three Broomsticks. At the same time, service is very fast and they are well organized to work with the crowds that visit. The major ""fast-food"" chains should visit ""The Three Broomsticks"" to learn how to be be a true ""fast food"" place. We visited on two occasions The menu is limited to about eight choices facilitating the fast service, but the spare ribs, fish and ships and sheperds pie were very good. They serve the house beer and also the butterbeer and pumpkin juice, and they don't serve soft drinks (sodas)."
I was just here recently with my boyfriend, and we weren't expecting too much from a theme park restaurant, but this place was actually really good! I loved the sheperd's pie, and my boyfriend really enjoyed his ribs and chicken. At first I was annoyed at the set-up (you order at a counter then are directed when to sit), but it was actually nice for a change to not have to wait forever for the food and drinks, or to have to leave a tip. The atmosphere inside was also neat. I'd go back.
I got the pasties, and they were downright awful. I couldn't even finish one. My boyfriend got the shepherd's pie, which wasn't terrible, but wasn't very good either. He liked the turkey leg, and we drank 3 cups of butterbeer. The atmosphere was great, but the food was not really worth it.
"We had the rotisserie chicken salad, which was pretty average, and a side to share of the roasted potatoes, which were actually kind of tasty. We were lucky and got a two top to ourselves, but if it is busy, be prepared to share a long table with other guests. They have a ""great feast"" platter, but it's designed for 4 people. Wish they had a 'mini feast' that could be shared by 2. Dining room staff could have done a better job of cleaning tables/benches. We watched a family of 5 get sent to a table that was quite soiled, with food spilled on the bench, which they cleaned themselves in order to sit and put down their heavily laden trays..."
What do you expect? The restaurant is inside the harry potter theme park. Same old over priced and low quality food. Had the rotissery chicken and sheperds pie, my favorite was the corn on the cob(how do you F that up? But they did). Not sure why they got descent reviews. Most all of the food within universals is overpriced and low quality
Food was not great!.. Would defiantly give this one a miss!! 
The food and atmosphere were incredible! We got 'The Feast' and I felt like I was sitting at the dinner table with HP and friends. The food was delicious and the service was great. The cashier who took our order told us a few little tips/advice and made some great drink suggestions that you can only find in HP world. Be sure to try the frozen butter beer and if your a real beer drinker try the Hogs Meade Brew. It was great!
We were here last April with our daughter, son-in-law and their 5 daughters. We ate here twice because we enjoyed it so much. We went early for lunch and so the wait was minimal. The food was expensive as expected, but was quite good. This was the best place to get your butter beer and the frozen was the newsy and so good when it was hot.The atmosphere was wonderful and added to the magic of the whole experience.We are headed back this fall and will definitely be eating here.
Let me preface this review by letting you know I'm a moderate-high fan of the Harry Potter books and movies. With that said, part of my experience at the Three Broomsticks was 65% fanboy and 35% objective reviewer.Because of how new the restaurant is and how iconic it is in the Harry Potter universe, there's a good possibility you'll have to wait in line to get in. They have a small queue on the right side of the entrance and at the time of this review, their is no awning for protection from sun and rain. Of course the rain started right around the time we decided it was lunch time. The line took 10-15 minutes to finally get inside.Once inside, there's another line to get into to get to the ordering counter, but at this point you get to see the decor of Three Broomsticks. They really did a good job in bringing the look out of the movie and into an environment you can smell and touch. In line you'll see the menu and plastic versions of the meals. You also see the semi-exposed kitchen where all the workers are preparing the many number of plates of food. Sadly no house elves were on display (a little Harrry Potter humor) but it might have been a nice touch to add an animatronic elf, although that would promote the enslaving of an entire magical race (sorry, I did it again)After paying for your food at the register, you're assigned a number and sent to another line to receive your food. There is a separate condiment stand against the wall for all your napkins, spoons, forks, etc.The seating was a bit confusing because they have dining room staff to direct you to an available table. We didn't know this nor did we see anyone to ask so we just sat down at an available table. Eventually we were asked to move from a big table to a smaller table. We didn't have a problem with moving, but they need a sign to wait for a staff member to show us our seats.My wife had the Fish and Chips. I had the half chicken (seemed like the best value for the buck). Both were good, but nothing too over the top amazing but definitely better than your typical pizza, burger and hot dog you'd find at another quick service establishment.We also had pumpkin juice and a Butter beer. I would recommend getting a bottle of water or another drink to have with your meal because both drink is a bit rich and not really a palette cleanser. The Butter beer was like a frothy creme soda and the pumpkin juice tasted like a ice tea with pumpkin pie flavoring.Overall, it was fun to get into the atmosphere of the world of Hogsmeade. And I would recommend any first timers to go and soak in the atmosphere.
Visited The Three Broomsticks with my daughter and her four children. We were going to get the Grand Feast but one granddaughter wanted fish and chips and another the turkey leg. I got the chicken and ribs, my daughter got the pasties with a salad about half the size of the $1.00 version at Burger King. We shared a butterbeer and a pumpkin juice. Both were good. My chicken quarter was so small that it must have come from a chicken not too far past being hatched. It had no noticeable smoky flavor whatsoever. Thank goodness for the little packet of bbq sauce! The ribs were very very small but tasty. My granddaughters thoroughly enjoyed their meals. My daughter did not like her pasties though. The high point food wise was my serving of roasted potatoes. Delicious! NIcely cooked, tender with crispy bits full of herb flavor. The corn was ok...big...but just ok. We sat at a round table in front of the fireplace. We really enjoyed the atmosphere but won't eat there again.
We went twice! Food is inexpensive and great. Frozen butter beer is awesome!
Lovely decor and atmosphere. Food was pretty decent for a theme park. Chicken was good, Shepherd's pie not so good. Loved the pumpkin juice and frozen butterbear.
32 bucks poorer for 2 shocking breakfasts. 'Farm fresh eggs' were advertised but they were dry, scrambled rubbish,probably powdered ( not the lovely little globes of golden runny yolk they should have been ) . A piece of bacon that looked and tasted as if it had never seen a grill, a piece of black pudding that was tasteless and badly prepared, chewy mushrooms a couple of very average small sausages, a small half a tomato, some greasy slices of potato and the crowning glory......a croissant and jelly. It's just not cricket !Interestingly the chap at front of house reported others had voiced similar views when we shared ours......
The food was tasty and reasonably priced. There were salads as well as chicken and ribs. Ordering was well organized. If you watched carefully you might notice the house elves.
Looks like it's right our of the movies and the kids LOVED it. Food was not that great but it could have been worse. Our reservation was for 9 and we went in 20 minutes early but still had to wait 30 minutes to get our food. They have a variety of entree's but none were very appetizing. Again... For the kids and they loved it. Would do it again.
The fish n chips were great - but this is the first thing we ate in the US that was not a huge portion. It was actually not even a normal portion size for us Canadians! Im a tiny girl and I was still hungry after! But let me tell you, it hit the spot! 2 non-alcoholic drinks, 2 fish n chips, and 1 dessert later we were $45 dollars poorer :( 
Tasty food, generous portions, butterbeer is so yammy! Take it frozen, it tastes better (IMHO). The Grand Feast for $49.99 feeds more than 4, espeasially if some of your party are kids.
It was self serve cafeteria style but it moved fast as they are well organized. We ate there twice during our 4 day stay both times had lunch. We had the shepards pie the first time and the 2nd time I had the turkey leg. I couldn't eat the turkey leg because it was too pink,didn't looked cooked. But they said it looks that way because it was smoked. They gladly gave me a different meal.
ok chips/wedge, good fish, nice ribs, yummy apple pie....smoked turkey was way toooooo salty
We booked Breakfast here which I think was a good option as it wasn't busy or noisy and we could have a good look around as the decor/effects are so good. We were a little surprised to find that it was self service (cafeteria style) rather than table service and this was a disappointment. There were 5 (I think) breakfasts available to order, American, English, Oatmeal, Pancake and Continental. They were acceptable. The food was nothing to write home about, but we liked being in the Three Broomsticks.
Food was great & the Butterbeer was good. The restaurant was neat to just sit in & look around.
It takes a while to get into the restaurant and order but the food is so good. Trying to order and get your food is like a cafeteria setting and gets a bit hectic and crowded though.
"The menu was well done and the atmosphere great. The meals we selected came with a salad which was a nice change from usual theme park food. The portions on the pastie was very small however. There are no ""muggle"" drinks served which was a fun experience to match the theme. It will be a tradition to visit here anytime we are in Universal's Islands of Adventure. "
As crowded as Harry Potter's Wizarding World was, this restaurant was near empty, with no wait. In early afternoon we checked out the menu board,which is very limited and starving we decided to give it a try. The availability of ButterBeer was also a factor for our 15 year old. The four of us chose the Cornish Pasties served with a salad. This is a cafeteria type restaurant, order at a counter and pick up your completed order on a tray, with self seating. The paper plates had 3 small pasties,each about the size of a tortilla chip, the other part of the plate was the salad along with a packet of salad dressing. It was quite the let down. The pasties were okay, as was the salad, the cost was relative. The restaurants dining area was in fitting with The Wizarding World and looked much like the one featured in the movie but the fascination pretty much ended there.
The Three Broomsticks is located in the heart of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Its theme holds true to the rest of the park and our kids thoroughly enjoyed it.Although it isn't gourmet food, the choices are different from the standard park fare of burgers and sandwiches. You may choose options such as shepherd's pie or fish and chips with sides of soup, salad, corn on the cob, etc. Butterbeer was a favorite drink and the spiced pear cider was delicious.Breakfast choices weren't quite as good as the offerings from the lunch/dinner menu. Prices ranged around the $12-$15 mark. Everything was served on plastic with plastic utensils and I think that could be improved upon.This restaurant is terrific for Harry Potter fans, but if you are looking for better quality food, walk down to Mythos.
We were shocked and delighted to walk in for lunch with no wait on Thursday of Easter week! At lunch its counter service with staff to find you a table so you don't have to race around with trays and kids...great!! Food is great and english pub themed and it is adjacent to Hogs Head for beer (real and butter). You have to look all around the rafters and keep you ears open for some extra Harry-themed fun!
We had pre-purchased breakfast for 9:30 am which got us exactly one thing - a little ahead of the line to order our food at a cash register. Then we got to stand in line & wait for a tray of unbelievably bland & cold food to be delivered. We were then asked if we wanted to carry our trays outside or sit inside. We chose outside only because it was so dark inside we couldn't really see anything & thank goodness because the only redeeming feature was the great view of the castle. Wish the park would do something about all the food which is worse than the food at Disney (other than Crystal Palace) if that's possible. Bring your own food. Pumpkin juice & butter beer are pretty good.
"This is simply THE place to eat if you are a Harry Potter fan and, to be fair to Universal, they have done an excellent job of this themed inn. We went at 1.30, much against my better judgement, and only had to wait about 20 minutes, which was amazing (quicker than my local TGIF). For my family of 5 we had the Grand Platter for Four, which was more than enough food and consisted of 4 of each of the following: Half chicken pieces, corn on the cob, pair of ribs, plus mixed veggies and potatoes and a large salad. For a theme park the cost was reasonable, especially considering how we used to feel so fleeced for food at Six Flags whenever we went.The staff are very efficient, and after lining up for your drinks you are taken by the servers to a table where your meal is delivered, so there's no worries about not finding a space.The atmosphere is what you would expect, with great detail in the inn building itself and staff ""in character"". All in all a very good place to eat whilst at Universal.Have an ale or a Butterbeer and look out for the Hogs Head behind the main bar, which moves intermittently."
When you eat in a theme park restaurant you don't expect amazing food and you don't get it here. What you do get if you show up at 3:00 PM is fast service and a place in the shade to sit down. Which is worth the high prices you pay for very very ordinary food. We had shepherd's pie, which was on par with a turkey pot pie from Marie Calendar that we prepare at home. And pasties, which were one step up from totino's pizza roll. The salads are better at Macdonald's. And if you are curious what Pumpkin Juice tastes like -- the answer is not pumpkin. The pumpkin flavor has been completely masked by lots of sweet syrupy something and clove. lots and lots of clove. A little vodka would help this beverage a lot, but the line at the bar was out the door, and I'm not sure they even have vodka.... Walk a little further toward Citywalk for better options.
Loved this restaurant in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. All the staff were just so helpful. Service was quick but the chicken was fresh & juicy. Don't forget the Butter Beer. Yummm
The prices are crazy high but not above normal for the park. Although we opted for the indoor seating, there is a nice patio out back that is a nice spot if you want to get away from the crowds. Another tip... if you opt to eat a little early (say 10:30-11), getting a seat was not a problem. Walk around a bit after your meal to take in some of the decor.
Being a huge Harry Potter buff I was incredibly excited to eat here and definitely not disappointed! We got the Great Feast which was a ton of food....salad, roasted vegetables, roasted chickens, ribs, potatoes and corn on the cob for 4. It was $50 but split between 4 people is about right for amusement park food. The chicken and ribs were tender and fell right off the bone! It was about 25 minutes to wait in line but it was well worth it....exactly like The Three Broomsticks and really ups the ante as far as the atmosphere goes. I will definitely go back to eat there on future visits!!!
My daughter and I had rbeakfast and dinner here on the same day. For breakfast she had the pancakes and I had eggs and salmon. We both had butterbeer. My daughter loved the butterbeer, but it was too sweet for me. She had fish and chips for dinner and I had the Cornish pasties. The filling was too highly spiced for me. It had more of a Latin flavor than a UK flavor. I highly recommend eating outside. By the end of our day, we needed a peaceful atmosphere, and the patio was the perfect place to sit and reflect.
We went into 3 Broomsticks after many hours in the theme park. We had home brews and butter beers and really enjoyed everything. The favorite was the frozen version of the butter beer. We were a group of teens and adults, and took our break while the more adventurous in our crowd rode the dragon coaster and then joined us for refreshments. The location was convenient to the ride, we all appreciated the details in the decor, and the drinks were yummy. Best of all was the hostess, Cheryl, who instructed us in the seating and ordering.
This restaurant is part of the Harry Potter experience, so its decor and menu have to fit that theme. We chose the Great Feast Platter for Four ($50). This includes a salad, rotisserie smoked chicken, ribs, corn on the cob and roast veges. Other than by adding salt+pepper, this meal had no flavour. We are used to spicy Asian and Mexican food on most days, so this mean was very bland by contrast.
You aren't going to find a cheap place to eat at a theme park, but for the price, this was the best food we came across during our three day trip to Universal. We both got the fish and chips, which was 12.99. You get a good portion and I really liked the fish! We saw the chicken meal on other people's tables and it looked great. My husband loves to try beer everywhere we go and said the hogshead brew was nothing special, and he wouldn't get it again for the price. The butter beer is amazing of course, and I loved the fizzy pumpkin drink too. We were there in the off season and even then the line was out the door. But we were probably seated with our food within 20 minutes. We actually went back here twice after disappointing experiences at some of the other park restaurants. Definitely the best value we saw. I heard they have a breakfast if you go early, I will be back to try that.
We just finished the main Harry Potter attractions and were looking for a nearby lunch. Walking up at 11:30, there was very little line and we were eating at our table in less than 20 minutes, but I could imagine this place could get quite busy depending on the day and season. We chose The Great Feast for $50 as we saw it came with a large salad and a selection of vegetables in addition to the ribs, chicken, potatoes and corn. We also decided to try the Butter Beer. Our kids are only 7 and 9 and normally eat like mice but they dove in as these are some of their favourites... We were really pleased with the ribs and vegtables. The chicken and corn were but both a bit dry. The salad was nothing special, being a basic mixed salad, but it was plentiful and fresh. Overall it really hit the spot and kept us pretty full for the rest of the day meaning we didn't have to get other snacks. Overall it appears to be a better/healthier choice that a lot of the other basic fast food stations around the park and it wasn't too badly priced.
Located in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Three Broomsticks is a cool place to eat. It is quick service dining, but depending on the time of year you go the lines could be very long. The WWoHP is a very popular attraction and thus wait times for everything can be high. When I went we waited for about 10-15 minutes to get in and another 5-7 minutes to get the food. FYI they didn't serve Butter Bear inside, but there is a cart right outside and also you can go to the bar area around the side and get it there as well. Frozen is the best!
Crazy long line to get in, and not a good lay-out inside. Prices not too bad for a theme park. We ordered the Shepherd's Pie, which came with a side salad for $9.95. Decent amount of food and quality for the price. Cost of drinks, especially Butterbeer, is expensive, but expected.Atmosphere appropriate for the WWOHP.
Had breakfast here as part of a package through a Universal Hotel in which you can only have breakfast with reservations. It was an excellent breakfast. The full English breakfast was authentic (I speak from experience) and almost identical to England. The porridge breakfast came with a nice hearty bowl of 'oatmeal' simply flavored with a brown sugar packet. Also a nice side of fruit with watermelon. The continental breakfast had a nice selection of fruit. The pancake breakfast was tasty. We asked for a change out of the 'meats' to scrambled eggs and were accommodated nicely. Coffee and tea were also good. Tip: look for a table outside since it is a nice way to get away from the constant stream of music played indoors. Also, take the opportunity for an amazing photo op with the Hogwarts castle in the background. No one will be in the background of your photo since it is at the end of the extensive outdoor area. Also had lunch here during the peak time and it was noisy but the food was still good. The fish and chips were especially tasty. Kudos to them for having someone organize getting your group to a table once you have gone through the line and gotten your food. This eliminates the never ending problem at theme park restaurants where you end up standing around with you tray of food and no table. It is probably as stream lined as possible given the enormous crowds that descent on this place.
Since Potter World opened at Universal's Islands of Adventure we've wanted to try and dine like a Hogsmeade local so on to The Three Broomsticks for lunch. There was a short line which we ushered to another line (#6) to place our order with Dorothy. The menu is brief: Fish and Chip platter, Rib platter, Cornish pasties, Shepard's pie and the Great Feast. Side items were available: Corn on the cob, fries, salad. My husband chose the fish and chips platter($12.99) and I opted for the rib platter($14.99) which came with roasted potatoes and corn on the cob. I asked Dorothy if I could substitute a salad for the corn and she said no. I didn't resort to challenging her even though the two items were priced identically ($3.49) as side dishes.  We found an outside table overlooking water. His fish(cod?) was battered nice and crisp, although a few minutes in the sun softened them. The fries were not very good. They tasted reheated and mushy. My two half rack of ribs fell off the bone and were juicy. The sauce was a mere ribbon but enough to impart a nice smokey flavor without being too over powering. The roasted potatoes were equally tasty with a hint of rosemary. My corn on the cob was fine and adorned with the husk shirred at the end as a handle of sorts. Our bill came to $39.71 which included a sweet tea($2.49) and a Hog's Head draft beer($7.25). For about $6 more you could get the draft in a souvenir mug. If there are four in your party, you might consider the Great Feast. The folks at the next table were dining on roast chicken, ribs, corn and salad. It came to about $10 a person before beverages.
this place is a typical theme park restaurant -- limited choices and pricey for what you get, but that's kind of what you expect when you go to places like this. Gets crowded for lunch, so we went early -- didn't have to wait. You order at the counter, then go pick up the food and take it to the table. The restaurant is cute inside and they have a nice outdoor area. Food is average.
To start with, the entire Harry Potter Theme park is overcrowded. This included The Three Broomsticks - the food location inside the Harry Potter section of Universal Island of Adventure. There are no reservations at Three Broomsticks.There is a long line outside to get into the restaurant, a line once inside that you need to wait to order, and a line to collect your food. Overall, we were in line about 30-45 minutes from the time we decided to eat until we actually were directed to a table. Surprisingly, the food was very good for an amusement park. We order the family feast, and it came with a very generous family style salad with good lettuce, cucumbers, carrots, etc. The meal came with chicken (tender and delicious), ribs (succulent), roasted potatoes (tasted like homemade), corn on the cob (buttery and good).For drinks, the restaurant serves the famous “Butterbeer” – a butterscotch cream soda with a thick head, and other assorted soft drinks. They also serve beer (including a decent ale)
Don't get the overpriced breakfast here. You wait in a line for 30 minutes before you even order your food. They give you a time slot. Ours was 9 a.m. Finally got breakfast (counter service, no waiters, mind you) at 9:40. What a waste of valuable time, and it was barely acceptable. Croissants terrrible, eggs taste powdered, pancakes taste synthetic, only good things were the oj, fresh fruit and my daughters scone. Not worth nearly $70 for a breakfast for 4. Next day, we went to IHOP, great breakfast for $30. IF you must eat at the 3 Broomsticks, go for lunch. Better still, get your drinks in the Hogshead and just hang out in the 3 Broomsticks while you gaze at the wonderful details everywhere.
Went here for respite from exhaustion and lunch. We have a child with celiac disease necessitating a special diet (gluten-free) and the staff was helpful in finding safe foods for her to eat. It did, however, take FOREVER for the food to be prepared, and we know to expect to wait for our order when we request GF food. For that matter, it wasn't our gluten-free food we waited for the longest, it was my husband's chicken and rib platter. The server was gracious about it, but it was probably 20 min we waited. And here is something worth knowing for other celiac guests: apparently it is contractually obligatory for butter beer to be topped with foam, and while the beer itself is known to be GF, the foam is risky for cross-contamination. From what I hear, JK Rowling has a chokehold on the production of nearly everything in the Wizarding World, and she issued this edict. Hopefully word will filter back that these kinds of inflexible policies are alienating to people ( in this case a child) with special dietary needs. My daughter cried for a bit, then got over it, but I sure won't forget it!All in all would say the restaurant enhanced our HP experience.
The best comparison of the Three Broomsticks is to Boston Market. It's counter service, but the food quality is better. It's not burgers-and-fries fast food. While the food was alright, it was not exceptional or quality. My husband had the smoked turkey leg and fries platter. The turkey leg was huge and quite tasty. The fries were overdone and it was a small portion. I had fish-and-chips. Again, alright, but not great. Both the fish and fries portion were small. For $12.99, I just expected more. Don't try to order a Coke with dinner. You'll be told that soda is a muggle invention and not available in Hogsmeade. The pumpkin juice, the pumpkin fizz (carbonated pumpkin juice) and butterbeer were all very good. Not ovely sweet, as I'd been led to believe by other reviewers. Other entrees our party sampled were beef pasties (the beef was bland, not well seasoned), garden salad (your average chopped salad, it did include chickpeas) chicken nuggets and fries. It's overpriced, theme park food. The seating was comfortable. The staff was helpful. We were there at the dinner hour and while it was crowded, we did not have to wait an unreasonable amount of time to order food, to get our food or to get a seat. Go if you must, to see for youself, just don't expect too much.
This was our first trip to the Harry Potter themed portion of the park and at the insistance of our son we decided to eat in this section. The interior of the restaurant was inline with the rest of the park theme, but the ordering area was a bit dark and lacked a sense of order or flow. We were directed to a numbered cashier to place our order and then to the corresponding number for pick up. This required us (two adults, two kids (7 and 1)) to navigate through the rest of the patrons. After picking up our meal we were then directed to the seating assigner who showed us to a table. The food was better than I expected, but I had to ask for straws for the kids (they are hidden behind the seating assigner) and lids for their cups are non existent.
"We thoroughly enjoyed our visits to The 3 Broomsticks. We went before the lunch time rush and once again just before closing time in the evening. Both times we just walked in without queuing and the waiting staff were very patient whilst we made our menu choices. You order your meal, then move to a serving area to collect it on a tray, then are directed to a table. It is really cute inside and the meal wasn't half bad either! We selected from the menu the first time around, then enjoyed the big ""feast"" the 2nd time through, with frozen butterbeer - yummy!!! The restaurant is fairly priced, has an authentic feel about it and was very exciting for our little Potter fans! The Hog's Head pub is inside, so hubby enjoyed a good English ale to boot! You can sit outside to eat in the shadow of Hogwarts, which was particularly atmospheric at night. Be sure to pop to the bathroom afterwards to hear moaning Myrtle!"
A casual sit down restaurant in The World of Harry Potter Universal Studios. the food was reasonable and quite good. Try the Butter beer without waiting in the lines on the street!
My family dined here while at the The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. We had the family feast which was roast chicken, pork ribs, BBQ corn on the cob, broccoli , carrots and roasted potatos served on a tray. The restaurant theme was right in line with the Potter stories. Clean and fun! Sure beats same ol' burgers and the feel kept us in the whole Harry Potter mode. A+!
The Three Broomsticks is definitely not your average Theme Park Steamed Burger Joint. The ordering process needs streamlining - you stand in line to be pointed to a register where you order, then are pointed to another line to wait for your drinks, then sent to another line to be taken to a table. If you ordered hot food, you're given a little numbered flag to take to your table and eventually they'll find you with your food. The biggest tip: Go Early! They start serving lunch at 10:15 and we went at 10:45 (we had a granola bar for breakfast so by 10:45 we were starving!)We ordered the Feast for Four, $49, and got a big bowl of salad, 4 chicken quarters (2 leg/thigh and 2 wing/breast), 4 2-bone BBQ Rib sections, 4 roasted ears of corn, big pile of rosemary potatoes and big pile of steamed broccoli/carrots. We couldn't eat it all and it was delicious. No sodas here (not authentic), but the frozen butterbeer and apple cider were yummy.
"We all know it. Restaurants inside theme parks are generally pretty awful. Amazingly, given the potential crowds, This one, in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter is really pretty good. I had the Fish And Chips, My daughter the soup (split Pea - perhaps a bit thick), and my wife had the Pasties. All of the entre's were hot, tasty (the Fish and chips in particular) and Flavorful. The salad were fresh. And they serve BEER (not ButterBeer)! All in all, it's as good or better than what could be had outside on the Citywalk for anything like a comparable cost (or in other words, I imagine that if you ate at Emeril's it would be pretty good too. . . .) So Don't Be Afraid. Go to ""Hogsmeade"" and have a wonderful lunch!"
I recently visited the Wizarding World of Harry Potter with my husband and three children. Visiting the Three Broomsticks restaurant has to have been one of the most enjoyable experiences of my life! The ambiance of the place in of itself is to die for! But couple the with the incredible food and amazing staff and you have the best theme park destination in the country! One person in particular I would really like to point out was our host Ben. He was just the sweetest person! He made sure to give each of us a personal experience while juggling an extremely busy restaurant and doing it all with a smile on his face! I had the fish and chips and I have to say it is a must have! Also, per the suggestions of my kind cashier Pam I opted for the Frozen Butterbeer...that may have made my entire trip worth while right there. Definitely a must do during any trip to Orlando!
We had lunch here yesterday and really enjoyed it. The setting is of course the main attraction plus you can get the kids butter beer without wating in line. We sampled the fish and chip (crunchy and not overly breaded), sheppards pie (very flavorful), the turkey leg (a little greasy but fun) and of course butter beer. Be aware that there are no soda products offered here but they have iced tea, sparkling water and juices as well as butter beer and regular beer.Ordering is fine but then you are assigned a que to wait for your food, which was kind of annoying. Then you are assigned to a table. The ordering process to being seated took about 10 minutes due to waiting for the food but it was all good after that.
This was the most disappointing part of out trip to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. The system they use to get you from ordering to table is chaotic. You wait on line to order at one window, then you are directed to another spot to pick up your food, then your are given no direction of what to do to get a table. You have to wade through the crowd of people who are lined up to order or pick up your food with you full trays (keep your fingers crossed that no one bumps into to you!) to get to another line where you wait to be directed to a table. Your food is getting cold and you are not even sure you are in the right place. I saw more than one person lose something off there tray and no staff member was around to replace it.The food itself is mediocre, but better than most things you can get at a theme park.The decor is great fun and the theme is well executed. But the table are packed in tight and the noise is unreal. We could not talk at all during our meal because we could not hear anything above the din.
We didn't have high expectations for the food, but face it, the fun is in eating in The Three Broomsticks, right? The best part is that the food was far from dire. We went twice: First time, surprisingly good fish and chips (I'm a Brit, and I'm picky about fish and chips, btw), yum butterbeer. Second time, the ribs and chicken, which were both fine, with the fun corn cob (I won't spoil the surprise) and tasty potatoes, along with pumpkin juice. The prices were theme-parky, but not exorbitant by that standard. The atmosphere was lovely. The service was variable, from extremely friendly to Attitudey Girl who really needs to be fired. Do eat here, because it's all part of the experience.
It looks very good. Authentic. Charming. Aged.... Cramped. Chaotic. Dark. Noisy. Hot. Rude. Cold Food....Universal was given the Golden Goose with Harry Potter and has no idea how to run it. This restaurant is a disaster of blockbuster porportions. The line moves slowly, the ceiling in the queue is claustraphobic and the ordering process is as if no one has every run, designed or operated a fast food restaurant before.There are also no choices of sugar free beverages other than water. Great for diabetics! No diet anyting.Now the food. It may start out authentic, but by the time the angry employee slowly prepares your order that has been sitting on the counter, gets your drinks and hands you the tray... it's ice cold. The area where you wait to pick up your tray is undersized and creates a frenzy of pushing, shoving and chaos. Now, you get to wait in a line of diners (with their entire family) holding their food trays for someone to allow you to sit down. There is not enough seats inside for everyone and no one is alloweed to sit down before you are holding your tray full of food. Not a bad idea if there was no line and you didn't have your cold food getting colder.Once seated, you realize that your $37 fish and chips with salad for 2 people has the charm of a cold London morning in February. Fine for a one time visit for Harry Potter fanatics -- not fine for everyone else or repeat visitors for any kind.
"We were up really early and as part of being on-site we were able to go and line up for the main attraction in HP. After we had a brill time we went to the ""THREE BROOMSTICKS"" for breakfast"".......STARVING!!!We lined up in then what became more like a McDonald's, then to be greeted by a ""not very happy to work there"" assistant. She took our order then lined up in another. The staff behind the counter and in the kitchen were so NOT interested in doing a great job it was quite sad to see, the magic that we were experiencing got a bit knocked out of us.That is not the biggest thing though.......we had an ENGLISH BREAKFAST, we can understand no Brit bangers,, but seriously putting a croissant with an English brekkie is an absolute NO NON!!!!!!!!Shame that alot of the staff eg, Station master, girl from Hogwarts and so on who they have spent a lot of time to get right was a bit let down by lacklustre service which I thought the US was famous for."
3 Broomsticks at HP land was pretty good. There was 5 of us and we order the feast for 4. They brought it out in a huge tray and we pretty much gobbled it up as is.Details:1. For a theme park restaurant, the place was decorated ok. Nothing too appealing but then again I guess it looked a little bit like what you would expect based on the movie. 2. What they could have really improved upon was the service. Meaning they could have kept a theme going or something. Instead it was par for the course as far as sit here and get your food.3. The place was a bit too messy for my taste but perfect for kids that can get messy. However, don't expect any kind of entertainment to keep your kids occupied.4. Typically a theme park restaurants food normally is not all that great. This fits that bill. However, the experience is usually what you pay for and this place didnt lend much to a memorable experience other that being able to say that I have eaten here.Overall, if you want to come here to say you have eaten here, do it. The food is ok and at least it is edible. It is just not anything great and I would say the atmosphere and service are on par with the food as well.
New way to order and seat you which worked out fine at our late dining period, 9pm., so no wait. Me, hubby, and two teenage daughters. Husband ordered turkey leg which was good . One daughter got a pasty- she liked it. I ordered a traditional fish and chips which was great. Table assistants at the side and with a wave of a hand will get you any condiments, napkins, beverage fill ups,etc that you need and very quickly. Would rec'd eating later on in the evening as the crowds are long at popular dinner times:4-7pm. Neat to walk around and see the HP decore which is worth walking around and checking out. There is an outside seating area with umbrellas and if you just want a cold drink at mid day you can order at the bar in the back and bring your drinks in the back and catch some shade. You have to look for these back tables as they are hidden.
We went to the three broomsticks for breakfast. We did not have any wait to get in as we had entered the park early using the early entry for onsite hotels. The staff here are very friendly and helpful and provided excellent service. We had 2 pancake breakfasts, one english breakfast and one porridge breakfast. We collected our food and were seated by another staff member who also kindly brought my mum milk for her coffee. The food was not that great, it was pretty average and was the kind that was mass produced. However I guess that is to be expected of an eatery of that size and with the number of people they must have to feed each day. The atmosphere inside was great, they have gone to a lot of effort with the detail inside and we also had a great butter beer here.
We visited Three Broomsticks Thurs. July 14 for breakfast because our ticket package included free breakfast. My dad got the traditional english breakfast, it is a little strange but sure is traditional right down to the black pudding. I got the american breakfast. Bacon, sausage, eggs, croissant, and breakfast potatoes. Mom got the continental which included very large pieces of fruit plus a croissant and very yummy blueberry scone. Bf got porridge meal. Oatmeal and fruit. All food was very good, however we were sat in a tiny corner and asked if we could please move to a more scenic area, which was about everywhere but where we were sitting, and the host said no and turned away. She then proceeded to seat the next family in a very nice area. We were one of the first people to be seated so it was just rude of her to blatantly disregard our simple request... oh well we enjoyed all the rest :) Oh! and butter bear... yummmmm.... :)
We had a late lunch here. Let me say first off that there was an associate at every step of the way that made getting our food and finding a table as fast and easy as possible. The prices seemed reasonable as compared to other park restaurants. I had the fish and chips. My middle child and my wife had the turkey leg. My youngest had mac and cheese. My oldest had chicken and ribs. Including my meal and also a taste of my families meal I would say the food was sub-par at best so I am giving the food 2 stars. The atmosphere was pretty nice as expected thus overall I give this place an average 3 stars. If you want good food go somewhere else.
Must admit, I didn't do my normal research on Trip Advisor BEFORE dining at The Three Broomsticks Restaurant inside Universal Islands of Adventure. We were presented with an offer to purchase vouchers for breakfast when we purchased tickets for the parks at the hotel soon after arriving. Breakfast inside The World of Harry Potter sounded like a good idea. The only problem was the food was terrible at any price, much less the price we paid. The eggs were totally tasteless, the bacon was half-cooked, sausage links tasted like rubber, and the croissants were stale and cold. We stayed at one of the Loews Hotels for 5 nights, July 2nd thru 7th, ate most of our meals in the park or at City Walk. All other meals were great, just not this one.
"Our family of six enjoyed our visit to Universal last January and quite liked our experience at ""Harry Potterville"". Coming from the snow and cold of upstate NY in the winter, it was fairly strange seeing fake snow on all of the caricaturized and interesting architecture. My girls liked their fish and chips meals and the prices were slightly better than at other eating venues in the park. The animated boar's head was a big hit and the bartender from Scotland added a nice European character to the bar. We loved looking at all of the details in the building and finding the shadow images in the rafters. The best by far ,however, was the outdoor terrace...the sun, blue sky and fresh warm air were fabulous for us winter weary New Yorkers. If you happen to visit in the summer, I could imagine that eating outside could be unbearable in the heat and humidity. During the hot season, the illusion of snow (along w/ great air conditioning) would be most welcome.The butter beer, though very expensive, was excellent and I really don't think that you can find a suitable substitute outside of the park. My advice would be to enjoy the ""pub"" and the butter beer while you have the chance!"
I believe that the food here was very good, I just wish there had been more of it! I had the broasted chicken (very good!), my wife had the pasties, and my daughter had the fish and chips. You are paying something of a premium for the Harry Potter atmosphere, but overall I thought the value was OK. The staff was cleaning plates as quickly as we could finish them and were very friendly!
Recent trip to Universal with my husband and three children. Had lunch here. First, the atmosphere was really great. Thumbs up on that. We got there early...10:45 for lunch, and we were lucky because the place was mobbed by 11:45am. Although we were in the theme park, the food, albeit expensive, was quite good. I had the fish and chips and found them very tasty(I don't usually like fish and chips outside the UK). My husband had the chicken salad which he really liked. My kids had the chicken fingers and they were good with this. The butterbeer was a must.I would return.
"Considering the sheer volume of hungry people this venue has to process every day, I wasn't surprised at the somewhat regimented nature of 1) ordering your meal, 2) getting your meal, and 3) being seated. It's impossible to replicate the ""Three Broomsticks"" experience we've all imagined from the books, of course - but they do a pretty good job even so. The food was just fine - certainly better than anything you'd find at a kiosk or fast-food restaurant. It's hearty fare and no mistake - my husband had shepherd's pie and loved it, while I had spare ribs and loved them too. The corn on the cob (a concession to American tastebuds, I'm sure) was lovely - especially with the peeled-back husk as a ""holder."" The highlight for me was the iced pumpkin juice (sort of a spiced apple soda) - AMAZING! And my husband seemed to really like the butterbeer. The prices were reasonable, the operation (by necessity) efficient, and the experience memorable. If you're in HP, I'd say go!"
Our family of 4 ate here for lunch while on our Orlando vacation. We had the family feast and found it was a lot of food. The potatoes were the best thing. We also enjoyed the butterbeer and frozen butterbeer. The atmosphere is great. Be sure to pay attention to the walls and ceiling. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone. Tip: Show your AAA or CAA card for a 10% discount.
"Wish I had read the reviews here first before paying $60 for breakfast for 4. Luke warm entries, which pleased neither the kids nor the adults. On par with poor/average fast food entries (we tried the American, English and Pancake breakfasts). Reservations still left us with a wait at the ""order line"" (don't even think of asking for substitutions), and then funneled into another ""pickup line"". Had two lines open for both, but why side by side? Lacking good food service organization, and it shows.Needs better menu choices (and less expensive/simpler entries or sandwiches for breakfast), better quality ingredients, better preparation and better presentation. This is not a $14.99 breakfast, not even an adequate $4.99 breakfast.The decor is great, but next time, we buy a Butterbeer at the bar, and sit and soak up the Harry Potter dining experience, without the food."
We ate breakfast here because we love the Harry Potter series. The atmosphere was amazing, you feel like you are in the book. There were only four breakfast meal choices and we all got something different. The pancakes were decent, smoked salmon tasty, the eggs were awful, but who goes here for gourmet dining? We loved the butterbeer!
We thought it would be fun to eat at the Three Broomsticks in Harry Potter @ Universal Studios, but were pretty disappointed. You will need reservations (at least for breakfast) and they begin serving @ 8:00am. The ambiance of the restaurant is wonderful, however the food is horrible! The eggs are the fake plastic kind and the bacon wasn't fully cooked. For $14.95 I expect real eggs and food that is cooked correctly. Ambiance gets an A+, Food Quality gets a D.
Although we had to wait in a line for about 20 minutes the Three Broomsticks was worth the wait. Great atmosphere, good food and Butter beer! The clerk was able to quickly tell us which items were gluten free so my wife and son were able to enjoy lunch without the normal stress of eating out as a Celiac.
We booked the breakfast at the Three Broomsticks as part of our Universal Islands of Adventure Package. I had to make my reservation twice, did not receive my voucher coupons and was annoyed in the extreme but the door greeter at the restaurant said they had been having problems with that and gladly let us in. I credit this to the fact that it was early and in late November and they did not seem that busy.I was not very impressed with the way we placed our order or received our food but the service was prompt and friendly at both. We both got the English breakfast and it was edible but I was expecting more. I totally agree with the whole fast, cafeteria vibe that others have reported. That said, I was VERY impressed with all the detail that they put into the restaurant! The Wizarding World of Harry Potter was the whole reason I drug my husband down to Orlando and I was not disappointed. I loved everything from the shadows that were cast on the walls and ceiling to the view out back. Just visiting the restaurant is worth the experience as a Potter fan. If you want to say that you had something at The Three Broomsticks, order some Butterbeer or Pumpkin Juice and just sit and enjoy the decor.
"Unreasonably awful! We didn't ask for much but we didn't want our ""ground Beef "" pastry to taste like ground earthworm in pastry. we all four got different items and took one bite then passed it around to see which was worse. The nightcrawler flavored pastries was a clear winner. You will have fun afterwards while you're puking in the bathroom next door listening to the ghost that haunts it."
We booked the Three Broomsticks breakfast as part of our Universal Vacation package. Although the atmosphere is perfect for all Harry Potter fans, the food is only a step above school cafeteria food. I wish we had just eaten breakfast at our hotel and just stopped in the Three Broomsticks for a cup of coffee. With your breakfast reservation, you go up to a register and order the breakfast 'special' you want. Then you move into a line to pick up your items on a cafeteria tray. Out of our party of 5, no one finished their meal. Other than the atmosphere, we were quite dissappointed with the place.
It was about 2 PM and the line was 15 min; you order and pay for your food and then pick it up at another counter. I had the chicken (average) with bad corn and some ok potatoes , but you do not go for the food but for the atmosphere; so just drinking a beer there would be fine. Unfortunately, you are there captive to the system and have no inexpensive food choices.
I had six meals here over the course of three days I spent at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal's Islands of Adventure. I got a complimentary breakfast for booking my trip with Universal - and apparently that is the only way you can have breakfast at this point in time. There were three choices - an traditional english breakfast, an american breakfast and a pancake breakfast. I wasn't sure if I'd like black pudding - so I got the american breakfast and it was fun! I also had the Fish and Chips which was absolutely terrific... I had the half chicken which was perfectly yummy and also the cornish pasties which was my least favorite meal I had here but still was good. I tasted many of their beverages and absolutely loved them all.Butterbeer - wow. It's a butterscotchy carmely cream soda toped with a buttery frothy creamy head and together they are decadent and delicious!Pumpkin Juice - Liquid pumpkin pie - but a little less sweet. So wonderful and tasty! Pumpkin Fizz - Pumpkin juice soda. To die for!Obviously the atmosphere is the key ingredient to this place. So charming and exactly what I imagined when reading the books! Make sure you watch the walls as you can sometimes see an owl flying by or catch a house elf walking around upstairs!Loved every second I got to spend here! You can sit inside and enjoy the atmosphere or you can also sit lakeside on the patio. Either way it is a charming experience.
Super recomendable!!! Hermoso lugar .es como estar en el mundo de Harry Potter y mejor aun la comida es riquisima y abundante...un plato para 4 comen tranquilamente 6 o 7 personas....para ir en familia comer bien y pasar un rato emocionante...muy buena atencion y muy rapida.
O Três Vassouras é uma ótima opção de comida inglesa na visita a Hogsmeade. Amplo espaço e decoração para e entrar no clima dos livros e pratos bem em conta por tudo que é servido. A dica é aproveitar e ir primeiro no Island of Adventure, almoçar lá e ir para Beco Diagonal em seguida. O povo costuma visitar o Beco antes de ir para Hogwarts então você vai encarar menos filas.
Se você não quer gastar muito tempo no almoço, entre uma atração e outra, peça um dos pratos feitos do Three Broomsticks. Porções grandes, para compartilhar.
Não se empolgue pelo local, tem que escolher bem os pratos para sair satisfeito, já pedi pratos horrorosos. Turkey leg desta vez estava ok, mas já peguei um cru é intragável em outra ocasião. Fuja dos frangos, tem uma textura e cozimento estranhos para nós brasileiros. Fish and Chips é a melhor opção, delicioso peixe empanado.
Mágico restaurante, dentro de mundo de Harry Potter , al comienzo esperas una cola en la que puedes ver los platos (son maquetas) pedimos el gran feast y no pudimos con el , gran cantidad y rico 
Muy bien ambientado en el mundo de Harry Potter. Tiene bastante variedad. Nosotros probamos la pierna de pavo, las costillas y el pollo y estaba todo rico. Las raciones son grandes. Para estar dentro del parque y ser un restaurante tematico no me parecio caro.
Minhas duas filhas são alucinadas por Harry Potter. Então fechamos a visita a Hogwarts neste restaurante. Não tem refrigerante. A comida é ótima com preço justo. O atendimento é muito bom e os pratos ficam prontos rapidamente. Pedimos o tradicional fish and chips. E também o prato com frango, porco e milho. Estava tudo incrível. E um mac and cheese. Recomendo!
L'atmosfera del ristorante è sicuramente immersiva, ma il rumore di sottofondo rende impossibile una qualsiasi conversazione. Qualità del cibo come da parco divertimenti (non si viene qui per mangiare) ma tutto sommato buona. p.s. La burrobirra si prende una volta e poi basta...troppo dolce come bevanda!
Detta matställe är ett måste för Harry Potter-fans. Mysig miljö och välgjord dekor. Nackdelarna är att det var fullpackat med folk och priserna var höga.Personalen hade kunskap om vilka maträtter som var glutenfria.
O restaurante e otimo para todos, mas para quem curte Harry Potter, a experiencia e especial. O ambiente te leva para os filmes. E a comida, apesar de poucas opcoes, e muito boa.
Cómo éramos 5 pedimos el plato La gran fiesta, q dice que es para 4 y le agregamos una pata de pavo. Fue demasiada comida!! Con sólo la gran fiesta hubiésemos comido bien. Cada bebida sale 3,90 y el plato la gran fiesta 60. Viene una ensalada grande y una fuente con 4 cuartos de pollo ahumado, muy rico. 4 bifes de cordero,papines, verduras salteadas y 4 choclos. Toda la comida con muy buen sabor. Había mucha gente pero la atención es rápida.
Vraiment un resto à essayer.. on a pris un plateau familial, et on s est régalé.... poulet fumé, cotes levées , légumes, maïs, pomme de terre.. dans un decor vraiment fantastique ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Um ótimo restaurante para almoçar no parque Islands of Adventure e que faz parte das atrações do Harry Potter. Pratos bem servidos e saborosos, inclusive um prato deu para comermos em duas pessoas com folga, acompanhado da cerveja amanteigada, que mais parece um refrigerante de baunilha. Gastamos uns U$25 entre os dois e saímos super satisfeitos. 
Comemos o fish and chips! uma coxa de peru defumada e um acompanhamento de macarrão.restaurante temático muito bem planejado, apesar da grande fila o atendimento foi rápido! preços exorbitantes mas dentro do normal para os parques!
Simplesmente delicioso. Aconchegante e agradável aos olhos. Tudo muito organizado. Peguei uma fila para almoçar, mas vale a pena. Super Hiper Recomendo esse restaurante.
Como tudo na área do Harry Potter é cheio! mas é rápido também vale super a pena comer no restaurante temático, super emblemático nos filmes, para quem é fã é imperdível!!! Comida inglesa deliciosa e ótima para fugir dos lanches.
Comemos o fish and chips e a costela.Sabor sensacional, espaço temático muito legal que para um fã de HP é muito melhor.Ajuda a fugir um pouco das comidas de fast food.
O three broomsticks é um restaurante temático em Hogsmeade, comemos o Fish and chips que estava incrível de bom e a shepherd's pie que é uma torta de carne de carneiro mas não tem massa, e sim um purê de batata por cima gratinado estava deliciosa também é acompanhava uma bela salada!
"Estivemos nos ""três vassouras"" e optamos pelos pratos bem servidos!! Ambiente muito agradável e temático. Eu quase não dei conta de minha ""turkey leg"" e dos acompanhamentos!!! Recomendo para os fãs de Harry Potter."
Für Harry Potter Fans ein Muss - sehr schön gemacht Als Restaurant weniger zu empfehlen und das Personal war sogar für einen Theme Park sehr unfreundlich 
Vale a pena fugir do fast-food. O serviço é rápido, o preço é bom, a comida é boa e a ambientação muito legal. São oferecidas algumas opções de PF (prato feito), e o fish and chips é uma boa pedida.
Assim como o Caldeirão Furado no Beco Diagonal, o Três Vassouras é bem temático, rico em detalhes, nos levando mesmo pra dentro do filme. Nós somos fãs então amamos. Pedimos o Fish and chips. Maravilhoso! O melhor Fish and chips do parque. O preço é bem razoável. 
Vale la pena detenerse y disfrutar de una bonita taberna, con excelentes fish and chips y muy buena atención. No es excesivamente caro y sirve para tomarse un respiro para seguir recorriendo el parque.
No hay mucha gente por las mañanas y puedes disfrutar de la decoración y ambientación en el interior. Hay varios desayunos incluidos en el dining plan de “fast food” entre ellos el desayuno tradicional inglés o el desayuno americano (ver foto adjunta). Para beber hay diferentes opciones como jugo de manzana, naranja, calabaza también tienen café, té o leche (también hay leche con chocolate).
Vale muito a pena, se tiver em um grupo um pouco maior, peça o Prato para Quatro, 4 espigas de milho (deliciosas), 4 sobrecoxas de frango, 4 costelas de porco, legumes e batata e uma salada enorme e muito boa. Valor desse prato $59,00 fora taxas, comemos em 5 pessoas e ainda sobrou. Louça toda imitando estanho, retratando á época.
A comida é boa, mas falta tempero... pedi um prato que vinha frango assado, costelinha de porco, milho cozido e batata, e o que mais se destacou foi o milho (delicioso!). O frango era insosso, mas a costelinha até que tava gostosa. No menu kids pedimos fish e chips, o peixe era empanado (acheio muito gorduroso), mas a batata tava boa.Ah, assim que encontrar no restaurante, vá direto pra fila fazer o pedido (fica à esquerda, assim que entrar). Não pode reservar mesa antes. É só depois que faz e pega o pedido que eles te conduzem a uma mesa vazia.
Wir haben hier Mittag gegessen. Die Auswahl ist OK, Preise, wie überall in den Universal Parks, eher hoch. Qualität angemessen. Ich würde ausserhalb der Stosszeiten kommen, sonst muss man ewig warten!
El lugar es un calco del que está en el parque de Orlando, sin embargo me pareció más caro. Gastamos 100 dólares para cuatro personas, cuando la misma comida en Orlando nos salió 80.De todas maneras lo recomiendo ya que la calidad de la comida y su sabor, no creo que se encuentre de enero de otro parque.
Todos que foram aos parques da Universal recentemente sabem que os locais mais visitados são as áreas reservadas ao tema Harry Potter. E com razão, pois o cenário é deslumbrante. Além disso, à esta aura diferente, foge-se ao tradicional hamburguer-batata frita-refrigerante. Nestes locais existem dois principais pontos bastante interessantes para comer algo diferente: Universal-Caldeirão Furado e Island of Adventure-Três Vassouras. Experiemente os dois, mas se o orçamento estiver quase estourando (todos estouram) coma no Três Vassouras. Comidas mais certeiras: Costelinhas deliciosas, pernas de perú, batatas assadas, milho. Tudo muito saboroso. Ah, não se esqueça das cervejas amanteigadas (a frozen é melhor).
Estuvimos el pasado mes de enero de vacaciones con mi familia. Fuimos dos veces a los parques de Universal y los 2 dias a almorzar a las 3 escobas. La atención es rápida y muy ordenada. En la fila pueden ver modelos de platos ya servidos. Pedimos 1 para los 4 que incluía pollo; costillas de cerdo; choclos; vegetales al horno y una fuente grande de ensalada. Todo super abundante. Nos sentamos a disfrutarlo en el patio trasero que es más tranquilo y con vista al castillo de Harry Potter!!! Imperdible!!!
Um dos melhores restaurantes da Islands of Adventure. Com um preço justo, um clima gostoso e uma comida boa, este restaurante vale a pena para todo mundo que visita o parque, não só os amantes de Harry Potter.As porções fartas, principalmente no almoço e no jantar.Um dos pratos que se destacam para mim é o prato tamanho família, com o frango, costela, milho e batata para servir 4 pessoas.Excelente custo beneficio!
A ambientação é incrível, faz parecer que está no filme do Harry Potter. No entanto, a comida foi decepcionante, realmente bem ruim. Estávamos em seis pessoas e ninguém gostou do seu prato. Se um dia voltar será para pegar uma cerveja amanteigada só para ficar sentado lá dentro curtindo o ambiente. Pelo restaurante eu não voltaria.
Estávamos a passeio na Island of Adventure. Achamos este excelente lugar para almoço. Pratos típicos ingleses. Escolhemos o tradicional fish and chips. Longa espera: 30 min na fila. Após a fila, escolhemos o prato, Fazemos o pagamento, pegamos nossos pratos no balcão e fomos direcionados à mesa. Curiosidade: há uma amostra dos pratos no caminho da fila. Assim podemos chegar no caixa ja bem decididos. Valeu!
"Понравилось больше ""Дырявого котла"", здесь, ИМХО, готовят вкуснее. Рекомендую взять Шеппард пай - он был замечательный, порции весьма убедительные в целом. В целом, в парках такого типа еда весьма и весьма кошмарная, так что здесь, можно сказать, кухня здоровая. Мы здесь также завтракали - невероятно довольны английским завтраком, очень сытно и полноценно. Да, недешево, но в отелях неподалеку всё примерно в те же суммы и обходится. Хорошее, атмосферное место. Есть задний дворик со столами на открымом воздухе, оттуда вид на замок Хогвартс :)."
O lugar é magico, me senti dentro do filme do Harry Potter. O preço é justo e a comida é deliciosa. Vale a pena!
Cerveja amanteigada e turkey leg, não tem erro, esse prato sempre faz parte de nossas idas e vindas ao Three Broomsticks , mesmo quem não é fã de Harry Potter vai adorar, o preço é muito em conta e o lugar maravilhoso. O serviço é rápido e de qualidade.Recomendado, nunca deixo de ir. 
Como buena fan de Harry Potter, era imprescindible conocer este lugar, y la verdad me encantó!!! El desayuno fue sencillo, no opté por el desayuno inglés que era más contundente (ya lo había probado en el Caldero chorreante) esta vez fui por los Pancakes, fue simple pero suficiente, lo mejor definitivamente es el lugar, la ambientación idéntica a la película que lo hace tan especial, me gustaría probar las opciones de almuerzo, quedará para la próxima visita.
Restaurante muito fofo e bem movimentado. Comida super gostosa também. Vale a pena comer lá. Restaurante temático
"O restaurante é bem tematizado, os fãs irão apreciar a decoração, com certeza. Porém, acho que os pratos não são saborosos. Pedimos o peixe com batatas (fish and chips) e as costelas (ribs), o peixe estava gorduroso e as costelas apenas ok. A cerveja amanteigada e a limonada são bebidas absolutamente horríveis na minha opinião; a primeira é puro açúcar, a segunda, além do açúcar, leva um pouco de água, gelo e corante. Resumo: se vc é super fã da franquia Harry Potter, vale uma visita no estilo ""fui, vi e venci"", porque a ambientação é bem legal; mas se você quer apenas comer algo gostoso, de acordo com a minha experiência, penso que no parque há melhores opções. "
Para quem gosta de cerveja, e quer fugir da amanteigada, o Três Vassouras tem um cantinho, à direita da entrada, com várias torneiras de boas cervejas; é um cantinho agradável pra degustar e descansar, com um ótimo astral, especialmente para os fãs adultos da saga. 
Fuimos por recomendación de la página para comer en el parque y no nos gustó desde qué hay que hacer fila antes de entrar, adentro y ver donde te sientan los precios son altos. La comida nada espectacular regular para un parque 
"Essen wie im Harry Potter Film? Im Drei Besen geht's.Wir hatten zu Dritt das ""Feast"" bestellt, obwohl für vier Personen gedacht. Vor allem wegen der großen Salatschüssel die mitkommt.Keine Chance die Platte geputzt zu bekomen: Vier Hähnchenteile, vier Spare Ribs, vier Maiskolben, jede Menge Gemüse, Kartoffeln und wie gesagt Salatschüssel. Mit 60$ nicht billig, aber Parkstandard.Auf jeden Fall lecker und SATT!"
"Jag och min familj var i Universal studios i Orlando i två dagar i juni 2017, var och åt kvällsmat på den Läckande Kitteln den första dagen, vi var där ganska ""tidigt"", runt 18.30-19.00 (vilket är tidigt för amerikanerna) och det fanns flera tomma bord att välja mellan. Det var en rolig upplevelse med bra mat för bra pris som vi kommer ha livet ut! +Roligt tema som genomstyr ALLT (Mat, personalklädsel, inventarier, möbler mm.)+Bra mat+Bra med sittplatser+Bra och trevlig personal+Fräscht och rent+Bra priser"
Siempre me ha encantado Harry Potter y comer allí fue como estar dentro de la historia. La ambientación es espectacular y los platos son contundentes, pedí un plato que traía choclo y estaban riquísimos.No necesita reserva y la entrega de tu comida es bastante rápida.
Imagina que estás en Hogsmade y vas al bar más popular de todos. No llegué a comprar nada adentro pero sí me tomé una foto en el lugar :)
Com uma cenografia maravilhosa e um cardápio inglês muito saboroso conquista a todos, fãs ou não da saga H. Potter.Esquema de fila q assusta no início, mas anda relativamente bem depois.
Тематический ресторан для поклонников Гарри Поттера!!!! Если вы или ваши близкие фаны этих книг, вам сюда. Приготовьте по 25 -30 долларов и поешьте. Позиционируется как фаст фуд, но выбор намного больше и разнообразнее. Мясо, курица, рыба, овощи на гриле.Интерьер фентази. Для этого мы и едем в эти парки, чтобы окунуться в мир сказки. Сходите
El clásico de Harry Potter Las 3 escobas es el lugar ideal para probar la cerveza de mantequilla con unos ricos chips de pescado o un muslo de pavo ahumado. La decoración es impecable y las atenciones buenas. Todo bien organizado. Las filas son enormes así que puedes ir bien temprano o esperar paciente más de 1 hora para comer. Por cierto el agua es free allí. 
Almorzamos aquí y pedimos el plato para 4, exquisito y gigante! Los choclos deliciosos, una enorme ensalada, las costillas muy sabrosas y para el pollo ya nadie tenía espacio Volvería
Local igual aos cenários do filme, a torta que experimentei era a base de batata, salmão e pedaços de camarão estava bem saborosa.
Além de ser legal para quem gosta de Harry Potter, a comida é uma das melhores que comi nos parques. Pedimos um que vem de tudo e tudo estava bom, vale a pena.
Das Three Broomsticks bietet zum Frühstück eine ähnliche Auswahl wie das Leaky Cauldron. Wirklich gemütlich ist es hier auch nicht, der Raum und das Ambiente sind um Klassen besser als das Essen. Als SB Restaurant muss man sich wenigstens nicht über den Service ärgern. Preislich eher teuer aber der wahre Potter Fan zahlt sicherlich gerne für die Erfahrung.
Il locale si trova a Hogsmeade, é molto carino e curato nei particolari dell'arredamento, peccato che sia un po' buio.Abbiamo preso il grande piatto per quattro che é abbondante nella quantità e accettabile nel gusto, comprende: 4 coscie di pollo arrosto, 4 pezzi di rostinciana di maiale, 4 pannocchie arrostite, patate arrosto, broccoli e carote lesse, una grande insalatiera di insalata mista, 4 bicchieri d'acqua.Costa 60 dollari e per il parco il prezzo é buono.
Se encuentra dentro del parque de Harry Potter, parque Island of Adventure, Orlando. Ambientado en los motivos de la película. Aire acondicionado que bien bien con el calor fuera. La comida es abundante y muy rica, los rifa de cerdo el pollo tierno las papas fritas o las papas aderezadas, algunos vienen con choclo. No venden gaseosa. Cerveza de manteca jugos, o cerveza tirada. Haces cola que va rápido. Los comensales rotan constantemente. Te toman el pedid, otro sector lo entrega, otro aderezos y cubiertos, y cuando vas al salón los mozos te ubican. Todo excelente
Decidimos comer allí por curiosidad porque de encuentras alrededor del mundo de Harry Potter y es fácil que te atrape, ordenamos unas costillas que estaban deliciosas, junto con elote, además que lo acompañaron unas uvas verdes con macarrón con queso, fue una comida agradable, además que decidimos comer fuera con una vista linda hacia el castillo, así que recomiendo acuda a éste lugar.
La decoración del lugar es una atracción en si misma. La decoración es impactante. Fuimos en plano horario de almuerzo y era muchiiiisima la gente. Pero están bien organizados así que no esperamos tanto! Compartimos costillitas y fish and chips (matrimonio y dos nenas) y estuvo bien para seguir caminando. Nos gustó mucho a los 4!El agua que toman las nenas es gratis. Y nuestra cerveza estaba buena!
Com referencias do filme e ambiente igual do Harry Potter , com comidas e bebidas exóticas , olhar bem o cardápio , pois com nomes estranhos pode pedir o que não goste , eu acabei pegando um bolinho parecendo um escondidinho de carne moída .
Muy buena comida, los fish and chips son riquisimos! Los precios son razonables. El lugar se llena de gente, pero está muy bien organizado todo. Un dato, desde el patio de este local de comidas se obtiene una muy buena vista de Hogwarts.
Taverne médiévale pur jus.Grandes cheminées, Tables monastère, Poutres apparentes (beaucoup), vous plongent dans une ambiance moyenâgeuse.Plats familiaux bien garnis, à prix très raisonnable.Ne pas hésiter.
Para quem é fã só a visita já vale. Otimá comida e um temático de primeira. Imperdivel. Peça a ribs que vem com milho cozido, uma delicia.
Decidimos comer aqui porque estabamos emocionados en conocer todo sobre Harry Potter. Escojimos comer el Grand Feast. Mucha comida! Las costillitas muy buenas el elote rico y dulce y te dan mantequlla para ponerle las papas y brocoli estaba muy bueno y bien sasonado. El pollo estaba un poco seco pero no feo. Lo malo de esto es que es mucha comida y al final la tiras porque no dan contenedores o bolsas para poder llevar lo que sobra. Asi que un tip si van a comer aqui lleven una bolsa para llevar lo que sobra.
No se pierdan este lugar para almorzar y descansar!!! Excelente la comida muy rica, ofrecen opciones sanas y los platos se pueden compartir (entre un adulto y un niño) ya que están muy bien servidos y los precios muy razonables. Mientras realizas la fila para ingresar, podes ir decidiendo que pedir, el menú está expuesto en un gran vidriera por la cual todos pasan. El personal es atento y servicial.El lugar es encantador, una experiencia hermosa para sentirte aún más parte de la historia de Harry potter!!!
春休みに高校生の娘2人と家族4人で行きました。娘のリクエストでここのレストランを選びました。リブが美味しくてビールがすすみました(^^)娘達はバタービールにしましたが、ジョッキはお持ち帰りできます。USJにも同じお店はありますがやはりフロリダで食べるのは雰囲気もプラスされ一層美味しく感じました(o^^o)
Para quem gosta de café da manhã americano o Três vassouras é uma ótima opção, o ambiente é super legal e a comida também ótima.Eu sempre peço o menu infantil do café americano (os pratos são padrão) que vem com ovos mexidos, croissant, e batatas assadas deliciosas.Meu marido pediu o mingau e também estava bom.O almoço de lá também é muito bom. Recomendo.
Tienes muchas opciones para almorzar aquí, pero las costillas bbq con pollo es riquísimo el precio es accesible $14 dólares me parece pero es muy rico! No dejen de probarlo igual la cerveza de mantequilla a mi en lo personal me gusto mucho :)
Dò quattro stelle perchè la locanda di Hogsmeade è ricostruita in modo perfetto! Il menu è rigorosamente british, niente soda o robe all'americana, mentre trovi pasticci di carne e fish and chips. I prezzi sono alti e purtroppo la qualità (non la varietà o la tipologia, davvero insolita ed interessante) del cibo andrebbe migliorata.
Avec un décors magique tiré du film Harry Potter, avec des choix de menu simple c'est un must de s'y arrêter..
Para comer algo , todo ambientado en el libro/pelicula Harry Potter. Variedad de platos como la tipica pata de pavo asada
原以為園區內的東西一定又貴又難吃但意外的不錯雖然很多人但服務生態度很好英文也還ok不會聽不懂
Eu estive aqui neste restaurante apenas para conhecer o local citado no filme. No Brasil, é conhecido como Três Vassouras, e logo na entrada a logo do local já mostra porque. Dentro a sensação de que realmente você está dentro do local é impressionante, tanto a escadaria na lateral interna, quanto o caldeirão gigante...
Lo que más me gustó de las 3 escobas es que podías elegir de antemano VIENDO el plato que ibas a comer, en la fila estaban los ejemplos para ver que te gustaba más-
Fish and Chips muito bom, comemos toda vez que estamos ai, acompanhado de milho doce e butterbeer ! Costelinha de porco também é muito boa ! 
A Universal não esqueceu nenhum detalhe, o três vassouras ficou perfeito, a comida suculenta e o atendimento muito bom! Adoramos.
Очень отличается от других кафе в двух парках. Там действительно вкусно! есть овощные позиции(салат и овощи на гриле). Я брала пирог с мясо и картошкой. Очень вкусно! Также, там есть бар, где можно взять алкогольные напитки.Не бойтесь очереди(а она дейтсвительно большая), она очень быстро двигается и касс очень много.Очень хорош для полноценного обеда или завтрака.
Recriando o ambiente de taverna antiga, é na verdade um fast food, mas que serve ótima comida, porções generosas e a bons preços. Vale a pena!
Esta ambientado como una taberna rustica y antigua muy en compost con el estilo de Hogsmade donde está ubicado el restaurant. Allí puedes consumir la típica cerveza de mantequilla bien helada y las comidas también de la película en nuestro caso pollo servido con uvas y cordero con papas y choclos...hermoso lugar para seguir sintiendote parte de la historia de Harry Potter muy recomendable!!!
Restaurant situé dans le parc d'Harry Potter avec comme thème vous en doutez bien, le célèbre restaurant comme dans le film. C'est un resto type pick-up avec table. Le prix est par contre déraisonnable pour la qualité de la nourriture consommé dans ce petit resto d'Harry. Pour les vrais fans d'Harry Potter, autres s'abstenir, il y a de bien meilleur resto pour le prix demandé.
Los dos dias que estuve en universal almorce aqui, precio accesible, buenas porciones, buena comida, ambiente inmejorable, casi ni hice cola, no tuve problemas, me encanto! larga vida a la cerveza de mantequilla
fuimos en la tarde y hacía un poco de frío. Pedi una sopa de guisantes que estaba maravillosa, mi marido una ensalada bien abundante; y mis hijos pidieron un plato de costillas, maiz y papas para compartir (y estuvo bastante bien para ellos dos, aún siendo adolescentes)La ambientación es genial, y a esa hora había muy poca gente, por lo que la atención fue muy rápidalo mejor: fue el único lugar del parque en donde nos ofrecieron Cerveza de mantequilla TIBIA. La pedimos y nos encantó: mejor aún que la frozen o la normal
Excelente ambientación que logra hacernos sentir parte del film. La penumbra del lugar, los techos altos atravesados por múltiples escaleras, las mesas y sillas, la vestimenta del personal ... cada detalle es perfecto. La carta es variada, los productos de muy buena calidad y los precios razonables. La atención del personal impecable. VISITA IMPERDIBLE !!!
Fui almoçar no Três Vassouras. Pedi um frango com legumes e a carne estava bem cru. O outro prato de carne suína estava gostoso. Vale pelo local, bem ambientado com a história dos livros.
La ambientación en excelente y genial! Realmente merece la pena comer en este lugar mágico! La comida no era demasiado cara y era muy rica, volveré algún día
El restaurante es fiel a la historia de Harry Potter, muy bien ambientado y organizado,se hace fila pero avanza bastante rapido. La comida por su parte no es la mejor, no es mala, pero tampoco es sabrosa, el precio para ser un parque en USA está bien. Probé el pollo y no estaba malo, pero no tenia mucho sabor, el maiz, ufff para nada, sabia a comida vieja. La cerveza de mantequilla (butterbeer) es muy buena, su sabor es parecido a un batido de helado de vainilla, puede ser facilmente un postre.
The day before we ate at the Leaky Cauldron it was good but here at the Three Broomsticks was awesome!!! We ordered the Great Feast and it was more than enough for 4 hungry people... It had 4 pieces of roasted chicken, 4 baby ribs vegtables and potatoes with butter, 4 corns and a salad... God it was soooo good... and it wasnt overpriced at all... Dont foget to order a butter beer!!! They are addictive... As a plus there was less people at this place..Un día antes comimos en el Caldero Chorreante y estuvo bien pero en las 3 Escobas fue fenomenal... Ordenamos el Great Feast y fue más que suficiente para 4 personas hambrientas... Tenía pollo al horno 4 piezas, 4 costillas papas y verduras al horno con bantequilla y elotes amarillos... además de una ensalada... EStuvo grandioso y no fue caro para nada... No olviden pedir las cervezas de mantequilla que son totalmente adictivas. Como un plus, este lugar tiene menos gente que el Caldero Chorreante...
"Primeiro você pega uma fila para entrar no restaurante, depois uma fila para fazer seu pedido. Por fim, aguarda seu pedido chegar e é direcionado a sua mesma por um dos funcionários, ou seja, não precisa ficar ""guardando"" mesa.Infelizmente não tem opção para vegetarianos, as o acompanhamentos (batata, milho, etc) são muito gostosos."
Vale a pena um pouquinho de fila para o restaurante, como restaurante temático de um parque é sensacional a ambientação e os pratos são excelentes.
"Pegamos a dica do Três Vassouras no roteiro do VaiPraDisney e deu certinho! Chegamos para almoçar pouco antes do meio dia, não pegamos muita fila e pedimos o prato ""família"", para dividir por 4. O custo saiu na média dos pratos individuais, mas vem muuuita comida, dando pra dividir tranquilo por 5 ou mais pessoas. O atendimento é bom, a decoração é bem legal (temática Harry Potter) e recomendo para o almoço no Islands!"
É bom para comer o famoso prato britânico Fish & Chips, de resto não vale a pena, pois eles fazem comida sem sal... vale pela atração do lugar e pelo Milho, se você não sabe, o Milho americano é doce, então cuidado pra não sair jogando Sal e Pimenta a vontade.
El lugar muy bien decorado para los amantes de Harry Potter. La atención súper amable y rápida. El único inconveniente es que el menú es muy limitado. 
Um restaurante temático no Harry Potter muito bom! Tem pratos enormes que dá para a família toda. Tem uma mostra dos pratos na entrada que te ajuda na escolha do pratos. A comida é farta e muito boa, vale a pena!
Muita comida! O prato para 4 pessoas comem até 6! Comida boa, mas bem gordurosa. Atendimento de balcão e rápido. Excelente pra quem gosta de Harry Potter! A salada é ótima!
Ambiente bonito e estilizado, mas muito movimentado, comida as pressas. Comi 2 vezes esta semana e foi a mesma coisa. Os frangos assados e coxa de peru super mau assado, melhor comprar nos carrinhos do parque, pois são mais saborosos e sequinhos. Só vende sucos, não tem refrigerante. A limonada é boa. Se quer conhecer, entre, tire fotos e coma em outro lugar. A única coisa que vale a pena é o peixe com batatas, meu filho pediu e estava bom.
Este restaurante está en el Wizzarding world of Harry Potter en Island of AdventuresTodo el recorrido de Harry Potter es increíble y entrar en esta taverna de piedra y madera hace que uno se sienta realmente dentro de la película. La comida no es nada espectacular, pero amerita pasar por la experiencia. Pedimos el plato tipico que es The Great feast platter, algo asi como el gran plato de fiesta que tiene verduras, carnes y choclo asado y los típicos fish and chips. Todo acompañado de Butterbeer y pumpkin juice. Precios normalesImprescindible pasar por ahi!
Das Essen hat mich positiv überrascht! Es schmeckt und man hat nicht das Gefühl, den letzten Mist auf dem Teller zu haben. Die Küche ist typisch britisch und somit auch sehr fleischlastig. Das Ambiente ist toll, ganz wie im Film :) Natürlich ist es in gewisser Weise eine Massenabfertigung aber das Personal bemüht sich, dass man sich trotzdem Willkommen fühlt.
Vale a pena almoçar lá quando se está dentro da área do Harry Potter!! Porém, achei tudo muito gorduroso. O melhor e mais saudável, digamos assim, na minha opinião é a Shepperd pie com a salada.
No restaurante a comida é uma delícia, fora o ambiente totalmente temático com um ótimo atendimento, e o preço não é caro. Não esqueça de pedir o turkey leg uma delícia de coxa de Peru com bacon...
Le pongo muy bueno sobretodo por la ambientación del lugar. La comida es normal, el personal no es muy atento y no te explican demasiado. Antes de volver probaría otros restaurantes.-
Ótimo restaurante temático! Atendimento muito bom.Comemos turkey leg acompanhada de batatas rústicas e salada ceasar. Sabor incomparável. Uma PRATO dá para duas pessoas.
O almoço foi melhor do que eu esperava. O ambiente é mágico, igual ao filme. O atendimento é muito bom e rápido. E os pratos estavam deliciosos. O preço tbm é muito bom, um prato c frango assado , batatas assadas , milho e ribs sai em torno de $ 11,00. Vou voltar todas as vezes que estiver nesse parque. Amei
O restaurante é lindo, você entra na atmosfera do filme! A comida não é cara e é MUITO bem servida, dividi o prato e ainda sobrou. Na fila tem imitações dos pratos pra você ver os tamanhos. Peçam o que tiver milho, é sensasional!
Más allá de ser un restaurante temático y representativo del Mundo Mágico de Harry Potter es una buena opción para comer en Universal Orlando.Tiene diferentes opciones para comer yo pedi uno con costillas y pollo, traia una mazorca jugosa y papas... Lo que me gustó más es que no ofrecen nada de refrescos o sodas, ofrecen té frio, cerveza de mantequilla o cerveza ( de verdad) asi que la experiencia saludable de comer en Three Broomsticks vale la pena. Valor de plato con algo de tomar por persona es entre 14 y 16 USD. 
Seguramente es recomendable, está casi siempre lleno pero se arreglan para que no tardes mucho en tener una mesa y que te sirvan la comida, yo diría que es aconsejable pasarse por aquí si visitas el parque, más o menos puedes comer un poco mejor de lo que se come en general en EE.UU, al menos para un español y en cuanto a precio como todo en los parques es más bien elevado pero es lo que hay, el sitio en todo caso resulta interesante y merece la pena visitarlo.
Os pratos são muito divertidos e extremamente generosos! Comemos uma coxa de peru e outro prato com porco e costela, foi um exagero!!! E vale a pena pegar a butterbeer frozen para acompanhar!
Restaurante imperdível para qualquer fã de Harry Potter, bem temático e com ambiente confortável. Antes de fazer o pedido você ainda se depara com uma vitrine que expõe cada prato principal em que você pode ter uma noção do que esta escolhendo. Estávamos em 4 e optamos por pedir apenas dois pratos, o famoso Fish and Chips: que é peixe frito com batata sautee e acompanha um molho bem gostoso. E um prato de Chicken and Ribs Platter, que é um prato com frango, costela de porco, espiga de milho e batata, uma delícia! E pedimos limonada para acompanhar.
restaurante temático do parque de Harry potter.comida muito boa!e tem até a vassoura varrendo sozinha, fica bem no clima do mundo mágico
Los platos varían entre unos 8 a 15 dólares aproximadamente. Tienes piernas de pavo gigantes como en la película, además choclo con mantequilla, papas fritas, pescado, pollo, etc. De bebidas también hay cerveza de mantequilla con o sin alcohol así que ustedes deciden cual les agrada más. Les recomiendo la cerveza de mantequilla y si van a comprar la pierna de pavo coman entre dos personas o una que tenga mucha hambre ya que es muy grande.
La visita no esta completa si no pasan por Las Tres escobas a coger un bocadillo. Es más caro que otros lugares peor vale la pena!! 
Ambiente e atendimento são excelentes. Rápido e organizado. Realmente parece que você está fazendo uma refeição dentro da literatura. A escolha dos pratos é facilitada através de uma vitrine onde todos os pratos ficam expostos. Única ressalva é que não gostei muito do sabor do frango com ribs e batatas. Achei muito gorduroso e sem tempero. Mas o fish'n'chips é sensacional.
La verdad que la comida que probamos en las 3 escobas estuvo riquisima! nosotros probamos el pollo con papas y la pata de pavo, y sinceramente estuvo riquisimo! se llena de gente, pero es posible conseguir mesa para almorzar!
Al que visita Universal Studios y Islas de Aventura les recomiendo alimentarse solo en este lugar. A diferencia de la tradicional comida americana aquí les sirven alimentos más saludables, como verduras a vapor, ensaladas, pollo al horno, maíz, etc. Y el ambiente nos hace acordar de los episodios de la película, que hace que el almuerzo sea mas mágico.
A comida é farta e gostosa. Mesmo com fila você não demora muito para ser atendido. E o ambiente do local é igual ao do filme. Vale a pena! 
Très beau restaurant thématique à Universal. Nous l'avons visité surtout pour déjeuner avant l'ouverture officielle des attractions. Le menu est plutôt ordinaire mais c'est à voir pour la décoration.
In un mese di vacanza in america coast to coast, non abbiamo MAI mangiato così BENE!!!! Cibo spettacolare, in puro english style!!! Lo consiglio vivamente!!! Un'esperienza unica! Servono i piatti di carne accompagnati da un pannocchia arrostita che è la fine del mondo! Carne succulenta e contorni ottimi!!!!! Assolutamente da non perdere se si va in questo fantastico parco a tema! Sembra di essere dentro il mondo di Harry potter sul serio!
O ambiente é bem bacana e agrada os fãs do bruxinho. Não há muitas opções, mas as disponíveis são gostosas. Vale tomar cuidado para resolver comer nos horários de pico, pois a fila acaba ficando pro lado de fora!Dica: peça a lemonade!
A comida tem o propósito de ser do clima do filme. Mas não é tão incrível. Experimentamos aqui a Butter beer que os personagens tomam no filme. Tem duas opções: gelada ou frozen. A frozen parece um milk shake Fique tranquilo: não tem álcool. Mas a cerveja tem em todo lugar na área do Harry Potter. Prepare-se para fila. Mas é organizada e vai rapi
"Se você é fã da saga Harry Potter e está visitando a área Hogsmeade no parque Islands of Adventure, então esse é o restaurante para almoçar. Gostei muito do prato ""Spareribs Platter"". Veja na foto. Vale o valor cobrado de $15.99. É bem rustico, mas estava muito bom! O problema é a superlotação, portanto, programe-se para almoçar um pouco mais cedo. O sistema é de balcão, ou seja, você faz o pedido e já recebe os pratos. E depois te ajudam a achar uma mesa. No Leaky Cauldron o sistema é melhor porque você aguarda seus pratos na mesa. Mas vale a experiência, com certeza!"
Se você for nos parques da Universal precisa colocar no roteiro o almoço ou o jantar no Three Broomsticks! Imperdível! Ambiente sensacional, comida muito boa, atendimento nota 10! Vale muito a pena! Mas é bom chegar cedo!
Belle déco d'ambiance.Bonne nourriture... nous avons acheté 3 plats pour partager à 4 (2 adultes et 2 ados) et c'était suffisant.Prix correct.
Realmente adoravel o restaurante. O ambiente nos remete ao Harry Potter. A comida é boa e o preço razoavel. Vale a pena almocar aqui.
In una perfetta ricostruzione della mensa di Harry Potter abbiamo mangiato bene e velocemente. L'organizzazione perfetta smaltiva efficacemente l'enorme folla di avventori trasformando per magia la pausa pranzo in un momento di effettivo recupero delle energie per poter continuare a visitare il parco.Buonissima la pannocchia al burro che accompagnava l'hamburger.
Excelente.  Amplo e organizado. Serviço de balcão: Vc pede,  recebe a refeição e leva para a mesa.  Recomendo a shepherd's pie.  Deliciosa. Recomendo!
Situé au cœur du village Harry Potter du parc Universal, nous avons découvert une taverne pleine de charme... Les prix sont corrects, la nourriture est copieuse, fraîche et c'était une agréable surprise pour un restaurant de ce type, situé dans un parc. Tout est fait que le service aille vite, file d'attente dédiée, service du plat principal à table. Vous êtes placés par le personnel donc pas besoin de tourner pendant des heures avec vos plateaux en quête d'une place !!! Prix raisonnable (7$ pour les enfants et en moyenne 15 à 20$ par adulte).
La experiencia antes que la comida. Es un restaurante temático, excelentemente ambientado, vale la pena, la comida es muy normal nada del otro mundo, sería bueno que la acompañaras con la rica cerveza de mantequilla, vale la pena y como Souvenir te queda el vaso que puedes coleccionar o regalar a tus sobrinos. Como es un restaurante Quick Service puedes compartir la comida con alguien de tu grupo y así aprovechan el dinero para comer en lugar con mejor menú o si tienen el plan de comidas de Universal solo gastan un servicio Quick Service y el otro lo utilizan por ejemplo en Beverly Hills Boulangerie.
"Em todas as minhas visitas aos Parques da Universal faço questão de almoçar no Three Broomsticks. Além de ser fã declarada do Harry Potter a comida é excepcional e substanciosa, qualidade especialmente importante para os brasileiros que estão acostumados com um almoço farto, diferente dos americanos. A ambientação do restaurante poderia ser facilmente sua principal qualidade, mas não é -- além da fidelidade de representação do ""Três Vassouras"" -- restaurante do mundo mágico do Harry Potter -- o cardápio representa fielmente o que os bruxos comeriam, inclusive não tem opções de refrigerante, pois no mundo de Harry Potter não tem refrigerante! Opções mais autênticas desse universo como cerveja amanteigada, chá gelada e limonada (minha preferida!) estão entre as opções do cardápio. As opções de pratos remetem à culinária inglesa, local onde se passam as histórias. Dentre as opções que recomendo estão o tradicional Sheppherds Pie, uma espécie de escondidinho de carne moída típico inglês e o Tradicional Feast, um prato estilo família que serve muito bem uma família de 4 (e ainda sobra mesmo com muita fome!). O prato vem com frango assado, costelinha de porco, milho assado, batatas e legumes, tudo delicioso! As sobremesas também são imperdíveis! Não deixem de provar a tortinha de maçã e o Chocolate Trifle com morangos. Em nossa última visita em um dia de parque lotado havia fila, mas não demorou muito até que nos colocassem em uma mesa. Enfim, todos que levo para conhecer este restaurante adoram, então recomendo de olhos fechados!"
Rústico, as acomodações são simples. Bancos de madeira. Mas a comida é muito boa e a decoração é perfeita. As refeições são bem servidas (pratos para crianças alimentam adultos) com valor honesto. 
Il ristorante è situato nella parte delle islands of adventure e all'uscita dal castello di Henry Potter. La scenografia è tipica del racconto e l'organizzazione eccellente. Si può scegliere tra vari piatti che e possibile vedere mentre si è in fila. Eccellenti le costolette con patate al forno e pannocchia. Possibile tacchino, pollo, fish and chips, pasta. Buon rapporto qualità/prezzo. 
Tem um prato neste restaurante que da para 4 pessoas. Vem 4 pedacos de frango, 4 costelinhas suina, legumes, salada e 4 espigas de milho maravilhosas.Vale muito a pena.
Visitamos no final do verão americano. Clima fantástico, comida muito boa e atendentes gentis. Ótima experiência, principamente para os fãs de Harry Potter!
來到環球影城哈利波特區一定要來三根掃帚吃個飯,雖然價位不便宜但挺值得的,東西好吃,尤其是奶油啤酒真的常好喝,無法形容的口感一定要來嘗試!
In den Universal Studios verbringt man einen der schönsten Tage in seinem Leben, es ist super toll und die Themenrestaurans sind mit viel Liebe zum Detail gestaltet. Der Turkey Leg ist super lecker.
A decoração do lugar é muito interessante e vale a pena visitá-lo.Pedi um fish and chips (peixe e fritas) e estava delicioso!Os funcionários são muito atenciosos.
这家餐厅位于 Universal Islands of Adventure。这个地方是哈利波特迷的天堂。餐厅的室内装饰是非常英式风格，甚至菜单也是英式菜肴，价格非常合理。我很喜欢餐厅的牧羊人派 (Cottage pie)。
Imperdível para os apreciadores do filme. Comida razoável. Adorei a limonada. A decoração é incrível. 
Ó restaurante vale pela temática do filme/livro do Harry Potter (todo fã precisa ir!)Mas a comida em si não é das melhores. Pedi uma torta que estava bem sem sabor.Não vende refrigerante, apenas limonada de acompanhamento.
Tal como uno se lo imagina de los libros o lo visto en las pelis. Buena comida, pero siempre hay mucha gente.
Invite a mi esposa, pero la atención fue solo normal a pesar que tenia muchas expectativas. El aseo estuvo apenas, no hubo la magia que hay en otras partes. 
Bonito restaurante si eres amante de Harry Potter, atención rápida, el fish and chips riquísimo, si lo acompañas con una cerveza mejor aún. Mesas cómodas
Lindo y temático, tal cual como en la película. Allí fuimos con mi familia a almorzar. Mucha gente pero se podía conseguir lugar después de poca espera.Comida inglesa. Recomiendo la butterbeer (bebida de Harry Potter)Dato importante: se puede llevar la bebida de afuera con lo que se reduce bastante el costo (no es barato).
Para quem é fã de HP como eu, não pode perder! O restaurante é temático, a comida é boa e pra beber você pode pedir cerva amanteigada. O preço é um pouco salgado e o local quase sempre está bem cheio, quando fomos tivemos que praticamente dividir mesa com outras pessoas (de tão próximo que as mesas para dois ficavam).
El restaurante de comida rápida esta ambientado en el del mismo nombre, muy similar al que dale en las películas. Es posiblemente el más concurrido junto con the leacky cauldron. El menú es original, estilo Harry Potter; pero no me resultó sobresaliente. Vale la pena visitar y tomarse una butter beer!
Comida maravilhosa a preços justos. Ambiente muito bem organizado e com decoração que te transporta para a realidade de Harry Potter.
Se está cansado de hambúrguer, esse restaurante dentro do Parque da Universal, Island of Aventure no espaço do HP é uma excelente opção. Preço justo e dependendo do apetite da para dividir. Milho doce, amei. 
Un éxito total! creo que lo principal es tomar la cerveza de mantequilla, si es que eres un fanático de Harry Potter que toda su infancia se preguntó a qué sabe. Pues acá lo puedes averiguar. Lo puedes llevar en vasos normales o por un poco más llevarte la taza para guardarla de recuerdo (vale la pena, creo que estaba 13 dólares). Una linda experiencia para los fanáticos de la saga.
Personnellement j'ai trouvé la nourriture très moyenne mais ma femme a adoré ! Un English Breakfast à l'américaine avec des accents de Harry Potter et une bière au beurre glacée délicieuse. Les décors réalistes vous font plonger dans un mélange de vieux pub anglais et de saloon de cowboy.
El menú no es muy variado, sin embargo acá puedes tomar una cerveza de mantequilla, un jugo de calabaza...La comida no es deliciosa pero resuelve.En comparación con otras alternativas en el parque, este es uno de mis favoritos
Restaurante temático da Universal que remete ao mundo de Harry Porter. O preço é um pouco salgado e a comida é Ok
Sirven los tipicos manjares de Hogwarts, esos que vemos en las películas de Harry Potter, coloridos y abundantes. Hay que admitir que el precio es un poco alto, pero lo vale! El lugar es magnifico y la comida es riquisima!
Me encantó la decoración y ambiente del lugar. La atención también fue muy buena, pero el desayuno que comi muy malo. El tocino y las salchichas muy muy grasosas, chorreaban aceite, y el crossant también super grasoso. Sugiero no comer esa opción de desayuno y pedir otra cosa.La cerveza de mantequilla si fue excelente!!!
De lo mejor de Islands of Aventure, Aparte de ser uno de los mejores parques de Orlando.. (O por lo menos es el que tiene las mejores Montañes Rusas), Islands of Aventure ofrece excelentes opciones para comer, Este restaurante ofrece excelentes opciones de comida a precios razonables, olvídate de pagar 25-35 dlls por una hamburguesa como lo haces en los parques de Disney. Aqui pagas 30 dlls por una comida para 2 persona, y no te vas a poder levantar de la mesa. Piernas de pavo, Costillas, Pollo todo en un solo plato. Delicioso.El menú es pequeño así que no hay mucho que pensar, todo esta delicioso, Nosotros comimos y cenamos ahi, pedimos, diferentes platillos en cada visita y todo estaba igual de delicioso. No te vas a arrepentir.
Hay bastantes opciones para elegir.La decoración realmente ayuda a sentirse en un mundo mágico, y a que la comida tenga un sabor bastante especial!
Restaurante bem imponente, chama atenção e desperta curiosidade quando passamos na porta.Comida muito boa, é bem rápido, apesar de ter diversas opções no cardápio, os pratos já ficam montados, o que agiliza bastante o atendimento. A única coisa que ninguém conseguiu tomar foi o suco, achamos muito ruim, gosto diferente, mas isso é muito pessoal.As mesas normalmente são compartilhadas.
"Sou fã do Harry Potter, e fazia questão de fazer alguma refeição nesse restaurante. Pedimos duas porções de ""Fish and Chips"" e serviu bem 3 adultos. O ambiente é ótimo, mesmo pra quem não é fã da série, e o preço bem acessível. O prato estava uma delícia, e quando tentávamos tirar uma foto, um funcionário veio prontamente ajudar. Quando voltar a Orlando experimento um prato diferente."
Almoçamos aqui quando visitamos o parque, você se senta em mesas iguais a dos livros e filme, a comida é típica britânica. Se estiver em família peça o prato grande, dá pra 4 a mais pessoas tranquilo.
Não tinha grandes expectativas com a comida pois a intenção era me sentir um personagem dos livros de Harry Potter. Mas a comida me surpreendeu. Estava ótima e farta. Preço também surpreendente por se tratar de um restaurante dentro do Island of Adventures. A fila é um pouco chata, mas nada impeditivo. Vá sem medo de errar.
La comida es abundante, muy buena y a precio accesible, a pesar de la larga fila la atencion es rápida y a uno lo acomodan rapido en la mesa, Los meseros tambien estan caracterizados con la pelicula, Realmente se siente uno dentro de la pelicula, todo este paqreu es fabuloso, todos los detalles bien cuidados.
Pra quem gosta de comida inglesa e ama harry potter esse restaurante e imperdivel demais, nao quer errar: va de fish and chips 
Desayuné y comí aquí... y me gustó muchoObviamente estaba muy bien montado... como en la película pero más grande... para que quepan más mesas... pero además me sorprendió la calidad de la comida... me esperaba que fuera más 'normal', al estar dentro de un parque... pero ¡no! la comida estaba muy buenarecomendable el ir si se está ne los parques
Magnifique restaurant avec des décors tout droit sortis du film ! Possibilité de rentrer juste pour boire un coup ! Bière au beurre délicieuse. Tout de même un peu chère !
Quando visitar este lado do parque dedicado ao Harry Potter, não deixe de comer neste restaurante, você se sente como no filme e a comida não deixa por menos, deliciosa!
Poucas opções de prato e um sistema de fast food relativamente lendo. O ambiente é envolvente, mas pagasse caro pelo que se come. Vale apenas uma visita. Tipo, entrar, olhar e sair.
O restaurante 3 vassouras fica dentro do parque da Universal Island of Adventure, na parte do mundo de Harry Potter. As opções do cardápio envolvem costelas, frangos, saladas, batatas fritas e a clássica cerveja amanteigada!
A parte mais legal do Três Vassouras é sentir-se no filme.A decoração, a Butter Beer e os pratos te fazem sentir no Harry Potter.
L'ambiente è più caratteristico e,a dispetto del gran numero di persone,il personale è superefficiente con servizio veloce e cortese. Piatti discreti e golosi
Hay bastantes opciones para solicitar. Y siempre pedir la cerveza de mantequilla (para probarla). Al ingreso en Universal te ofrecen un ticket para comida (incluye una comida, bebida y snack). La cerveza de mantequilla incluye como snack.
É um bom restaurante que segue a temática da área do Harry Potter na Universal. É do tipo fast food e fica bem cheio na hora do almoço. Mas mesmo cheio, o atendimento é eficiente e rápido. O preço é acessível. Os pratos são muito bons.
Restaurante interessante ,bonito, descontraído.A comida e razoável . Para os fãs de Harry Potter, recomendo entrar sentar e tomar uma butter beer .O atendimento e razoável .
"Todos sabemos que comer dentro de los parques es todo un tema. Si estas cerca al castillo de harry potter (justo frente al ingreso del juego de los dragones) esta es una súper opción! Nosotros fuimos 8 y con 1 plato llamado ""The great fest"" ($50) fue suficiente! Dice q es para 4 pero es bastante abundante. También hay la opción de cerveza (dulce) para niños y hay un bar para adultos q sirve cerveza al puro estilo inglés. "
Sendo ou não fã de Harry Potter você irá adorar essa opção para fazer sua refeição. Se você é fã, será transportado para dentro do filme, tamanha a riqueza de detalhes e cuidado em reproduzir tudo dos filmes, se você não conhece os filmes ou livros, comerá uma ótima comida , com bom preço , dentro de um grande salão , rústico, com arquitetura magnífica. Simplesmente não tem como não gostar, eu sugiro beber a Frozen Butterfly Beer , que vem com raspilhas de gelo, ideal para os dias de calor, para comer, não tenho preferência, é tudo muito bom, mas a Turkey Leg é simplesmente fantástica e rende ótimas fotos. 
A tematização e praticamente impecável. O atendimento e muito bom e cordial como em qualquer parte do Universal orlando resort. A comida boa e o preço um pouco caro, mas esta na media do restante do parque. Para quem não tem muito conhecimento de ingles o restaurante conta com a facilidade de ter os pratos nas vitrines para facilitar as escolhas.
Simplesmente perfeito, é como estar dentro dos filmes da franquia Harry Potter, comendo pratos típicos e deliciosos!
La ambientación es espectacular. Es como entrar en la escenografía de la película. La calidad de la comida es muy buena. Las ensaladas de fruta y butterbeer helada en verano son geniales!!
Parada obrigatória quando fazendo uma visita ao parque do Harry Potter, comida excelente, preços justos e atendimento super rápido.
Apesar dos preços caros.. Vale a pena simplesmente pelo passeio, que te leva pra dentro do restaurante Três Vassouras do mundo de HP..
es un lugar muy bien ambientado con gestion de la espera, y que tiene esos toques magicos que esperas en el mundo de Harry Potter
Você terá que ter paciência para aguardar na fila para ser atendido, mas vale a pena pela experiência de comer em um ambiente tão Harry Potter. Apesar de estar sempre cheio, após pegar a bandeja você não tem que aguardar muito porque tem ao menos uns três funcionários apenas para ficar verificando e guiando às mesas vagas,
Ir ao parque do Harry Potter enão comer no Três Vassouras é quase um crime para quem é fã do bruxinho. Mas caso esse não seja o seu caso, dá pra passar esse restaurante que não oferece nada tão diferente. A comida não é a mais gostosa dentro do parque. Vale a pena só pra conhecer e se encantar com a magia.
Almocei no três vassouras em visita ao complexo do harry potter almoço muito gosto em media de 20 dolares a refeição com bebida, representa bem o filme e com grande agilidade no atendimento.
Com certeza tomei a melhor limonada da minha vida, até o momento! Os pratos são um pouco mais caros que os demais que comemos, mas o Fish and chips estava bem gostoso!
Local na entrada do mundo de Harry potter no Island of adventure. Restaurante quick service, nao precisa fazer reserva. Logo na entrada , ha uma vitrine com os pratos. Pra quem vi com familia, ha um prato gigante que serve bem uns 4 adultos, e se nao me engano custa U$ 39,90. Vale muito.!!!
Continuando a viagem pelo mundo do Harry Porter nossa opção foi almoçar nesse restaurante. Ambiente muito bem decorado com cardápio típico de Londres. Oferece várias opções de cervejas.
Está com muita fome? Sim lá vc vai matar sua fome. Eu pedi o prato chickem and rios. E amei achei que não ficaria satisfeito e estranhei o milho ser doce nos Estados Unidos 
Bonita ambientação estilo Harry Potter, comida boa e cerveja top (Hog's Head) no estilo inglês. Boa organização com ajuda para pegar mesas. Pela decoração já vale a visita. 
O restaurante tem uma decoração bem legal, e os pratos fazem uma menção a varios pratos citados nos livros. A comida não tem nada de mais, pedi um Fish and Chips, estava bom.
Più che buon posto dove fare una pausa culinaria all’interno del favoloso parco “Universal's Island Of Adventure”, sempre pieno di gente e con un più che buon rapporto qualità/prezzo. Ottima la carne.
"Ich finde das ""Three Broomsticks"" deutlich besser als das ""Leaky Cauldron"" in der Diagon Alley. Das Ambiente ist hier viel schöner. Unter anderem mit dem tollen Ausblick auf ""Hogwarts"" und der Stadt im Allgemeinen. Wenn man nicht dringend die Klimaanlage braucht empfehle ich ""hinter"" dem Restaurant zu essen."
"Ambiente agradável para quem curte os livros de Harry Potter, boa comida no estilo britânico e atendimento correto. Nosso filho adora o ""fish and chips"" do menu infantil."
Não gostamos. Comida sem gosto. Coxa de peru MUITO SALGADA, não peça, pricipalmente se quiser cuidar do sódis. Meio desorganizafo. Menu restrito. O Leakong Cauldron no Universal é bem melhor!
Restaurante que fica na parte do Harry Potter da Universal, não peganos muita fila. Pedimos fish e chip que estava delicioso. Valeu conhecer.
Vale a pena para não sair do ambiente harry potter, e tambem comer aquele fast food por um preço razoavel
Ambiente según el libro de Harry Potter, muy inglés. . La comida muy rica y diferente a lo demás del parque, has reservas.
Cheguei cedo ao parque e fui tomar café depois de alguns passeios. Café da manhã tipo americano (tem outros) com ovos e salsicha. Foi muito bom. É meio caro, mas é uma opção dentro do parque - que não tem nada barato!
Dá para sentar e se sentir em Hogsmeade e no mundinho do Harry Potter. Os pratos são gostosos, simples e rápidos e é possível experimentar o suco de abobora. Tem muita gente fantasiada como bruxos e bruxas de Hogwarts e lembra muito a descrição do livro. Vale a pena conferir
A comida do restaurante não é excelente, mas é muito gostosa. O atendimento foi bem cordial e, assim que você entra, consegue sentir toda a atmosfera mágica desta região do parque. Parada obrigatória para quem gosta de Harry Potter.
Inmerso en el mundo magico de Harry Potter este restaurante es ideal para desayunar y seguir disfrutando de todo el potencial de este maravilloso lugar. Con posibilidad de elegir desayunos de distintos formatos ya prestablecidos que abarcan los diferentes gustos, con una muy buena atencion y servicio.
Immersion totale dans le monde de harry potter, on boit de la bièrreaubeurre ou du jus de citrouille dans l'une des salles (les trois balais ou la tête de sanglier) avec leurs décors emblématiques ! seul bémol : le prix mais on est a universal ;-)
Gente o Peixe de lá é muito muito muito bom. Local espaçoso e tudo a ver com a tematica do local. A cerveja amantegada é BEM DOCE. Pensem nela como uma sobremesa.Mas recomendo o local para uma boa refeição.
Ótimo local pra refeição, bom pra sentar e refrescar-se, tudo de lá é gostoso, os funcionários são bem atenciosos.
Otimo lugar para sentir em Hogsmeade e no mundinho do Harry Potter. Os pratos são gostosos e é possivel experimentar o suco de abobora.Vale a pena conferir
Wir hatten schon mit dem Schlimmsten gerechnet, aber wurden positiv überrascht. Wir hatten einen Truthahnkeule bestellt mit Bratkartoffeln und ich befürchtete schon, dass dies ein Reinfall wird. Aber welch eine Überraschung - das Fleisch war butterzart und sehr schmackhaft. Angesichts der Menge an Besucher die stündlich abgefertigt werden, ist die Qualität wirklich gut. 
La comida puede resultar un poco cara pero es rica y variada. El ambiente es increíble, es recomendable pasear por el patio trasero que tiene varios detalles de Harry Potter también.
Hbaía mucha cola para pedir el desayuno, pero la atención fue correcta. Me bajó la presión y me ofrecieron café y una medialuna a causa de esto. Muy buena la atención
Na minha opinião só vale pela atmosfera Harry Potter.A comida não é ruim mas está longe de ser um primor. Mas já que ficamos muitas horas no parque e temos que comer algo...cumpre o objetivo.
Adoro este restaurante e sempre que estamos no Island almoçamos nele!! Mesmo que tenha fila, ela anda rápido e primeiro vc escolhe, paga, vai para o balcão pegar a comida e aí sim vc pode procurar um lugar para sentar. Mesmo que esteja com mais pessoas, todos deverão permanecer o tempo inteiro juntos. O esquema deles funciona muito bem e nunca há fila para se sentar!! É tudo muito rápido!! A comida é bem gostosa mesmo e os pratos são grandes. Dá pra dividir. Pedi uma costela com milho (eu amo o milho adocicado deles!!) e batatas. Estava muito saboroso!! Recomendo!!!!
Es una experiencia increíble, como estar en la película. Los precios son buenos, teniendo en cuenta que es un parque temático. La comida es buena y hay platos para compartir.
Petit resto dans le monde d'Harry Potter. Idéal pour se mettre dans l'ambiance des films d'Harry Potter, C'est une réplique quasi exacte de restaurant
Apesar de não gostar nada, nada, do tema bruxo, o restaurante é muito bom. Comi a costela de porco (maravilhosa) e minha esposa o peixe com fritas (muuuito bom). Todo ambientado no ambiente Potter. O preço também é altamente acessível, com pratos a US$ 13 e bem servidos.
Toda vez que vamos lá nos encantamos cada vez mais. Comida saborosa a preços acessiveis em relação a outros restaurantes.
é mágico para um fã comer no 3 vassouras! é emocionante, vc se sente parte do mundo mágico! Atendimento de primeira, funcionários sempre rindo e divertindo com você!
Muy buena decoracion realmente parece estar dentro de la peli, sin palabras la comida buena, precios obvio un poco caro pero toda la comida en los parques es un tanto de costos altos y siempre hay mucha fritura para variar.Pero da gusto comer aqui toda una aventura.
Buen restaurante estilo ingles. La decoración es genial y la comida es de buen sabor. Como toda comida dentro de los parques no es barata pero vale la pena.
O restaurante está sempre muito cheio, as filas são enormes.Pra sentar é outra chatice.A comida não é boa, pedi uma sopa e uma salada, meu marido pediu o peixe com batatas, mas nada estava bom.
Un mix entre Junkfood américaine et plat british.Pour ma part j'y ai très bien mangé, et les prix sont très abordables.Par contre, allez-y soit très tôt, soit très tard. C'est toujours rempli !
Para quem é fã do Harry Potter o lugar é muito bacana a decoração é sensacional, a comida é boa e o preço é razoável e o atendimento foi bem rápido e foi bem tranquilo eu conseguir uma mesa.
Depois de acordar cedinho para pegar a entrada mais cedo dos hóspedes da Universal, decidimos depois tomar o café da manhã lá e as opções são ótimas. É como um fast-food de café da manhã, você escolhe se quer: continental, americano ou inglês,e trazem um prato já montado. Super organizado no atendimento, e para completar, o cenário dá o tom diferente e sabor de encantamento.
Restaurante temático da área do harry potter. Não precisa ser fã para se encantar, ambiente ótimo, comida boa e preço justo. Gostamos tanto que fomos duas vezes.
Fomos em cinco e pedimos a porção pra quatro! E sobrou! E ainda vem uma saladinha deliciosa pra tirar a culpa. Frango, costelinha, batatas assadas, milho cozinho e legumes tudo delicioso! De todos os restaurantes que comi no parque suuuuper sugiro, pelo preço e pela qualidade, gastamos 14,00 dólares já com as bebidas e enfim além de tudo a caracterização é perfeita!
O ambiente é lindo mas não compensa o custo benefício. Comida razoável. Peguei uma coxa de frango no prato Festival que estava quase crua. mas o ambiente é lindo. Guarde seus dólares para as lojas da Universal, que tem produtos bacanas, mas super caros. Melhor tomar uma cerveja amanteigada no quiosque da frente e seguir para comer um hot dog em outro departamento do parque.
El restaurante es de autoservicio, amplio cómodo y te transporta al mundo Potter.La comida muy buena, sabrosa y en buenas raciones.La decoración es extraordinaria y el servicio del personal muy bueno.Me encantó la sidra de manzana y el pollo.
Te sentís adentro de la pelicula misma!! Es un lugar ideal para fanáticos, y los que no los son lo terminaran siendo! 
Uma ótima parada para se deliciar e tomar uma cerveja amanteigada!! perto do horário de almoço costuma ser mais cheio, mas nada que alguns minutos na fila de espera não compensem!
"Molto simile ai ""tre manici di scopa"" del film, solo in scala mastodontica! L'unica pecca oltre ai prezzi altissimi: il fatto che (almeno in dicembre) è praticamente impossibile trovar posto! Però che emozione... FANTASTICO!"
Desde que estás en la puerta de las 3 escobas estás dentro de la película, la comida es excelente, recomiendo el pescado y las costillas están verdaderamente deliciosas ya sea con un riquisimo jugo de calabaza o una limonada, para posteriormente sellar el momento con una deliciosa cerveza de mantequilla, el restaurante está verdaderamente de foto, es una réplica exácta de la película vale la pena solo por estar ahí y aunque la comida es muy rica, si solo se quiere disfrutar de la cerveza también es excelente, estando en hogsmeade y visitando Hogwarts no debe de faltar la visita a las 3 escobas.
"Siamo stati qui a pranzo durante la nostra visita all'""Island of Adventure"". l'interno è ricreato alla perfezione e il cibo è abbastanza buono, ma certamente non era il nostro interesse principale... la burrobirra è imbevibile. vale la pena di entrarci solamente per respirare ancora più a fondo la sensazione di essere nel mondo di Harry Pottere!"
Pase por ahí de casualidad cuando estaba por la zona de Harry Potter en Island of Adventures. La comida estaba rica, pero demasiado cara (eso no es extraño, siempre es así en los parques de atracciones). Compre una ensalada super pequeña y salió US$ 4, lo cual me pareció excesivo. Sin embargo vale la pena visitar ya que el ambiente y decoración te hace sentir que estuvieras en la pelicula.Vale la pena probar la cerveza de mantequilla que por cierto sabe a vainilla. ;)
Nous y avons pris le petit déjeuner après avoir fait les attractions.Tout y était délicieux, le cadre est génial, on s'y croirait!
Le cadre est génial! Nous sommes en pleine immersion. Par contre impossible de choisir notre table, on nous place (pas forcement la table qu'on aurai choisi) et on a l'impression d'être surveillé tout au long du repas (en réalité c'est juste le personnel qui fait le pied de grue en attendant d'autres clients à placer). Ça casse la magie, mais ça ne m'étonne pas d'Universal où tout est interdit, surveillé, dicté...Le fish and ships été bon, les autres plats avaient l'air... particuliers...
J'ai bien aimé ce restaurant. J'ai évité la file d'attente en y allant a 11 hrs am. Le service était rapide. Nos plats étaient bons ( salade pour moi et cuisse de dinde pour mon conjoint). Le décor est vraiment beau. Le prix est cher mais ok pour un parc d'Orlando ( 50$/4).
Decoração linda e perfeitamente fiel a saga! Comida excelente e preço compatível aos demais restaurantes do parque.
Bellissima l'ambientazione (realmente sembra di stare nel set del film di Potter!). Il cibo e' nella media, senza troppe pretese. Le bambine hanno ordinato cosce di pollo con patate e fish&chips, entrambi dignitosi. 
Yomi, si alguna vez soñaste con cenar en el comedor de Hogwarts, debes venir aquí, aunque sea para una foto, a demás de que la cerveza de mantequilla esta deliciosa.
"O restaurante é uma taverna rústica existente na Vila de Hogsmeade, no estilo do restaurante Caldeirão Furado no parque Universal. No local é servido o famoso ""Great Feast Platter"" (Coisa de U$20,00 / U$ 25,00 por pessoa e serve 04 pessoas - vem com salada de folhas e uma bandeja enorme com quatro milhos cozidos fantásticos e deliciosos, quatro pedaços generosos de frango (coxa/sobrecoxa e peito), quatro pedaços de costela ao molho de churrasco, batatas assadas e legumes cozidos). É, sem dúvida, uma refeição espetacular!!!! A comida é muito, mas muito gostosa!!!! Fã ou não de Harry Potter é uma experiência muito bacana, que faz com que você se sinta dentro do filme, e a comida vale muito a pena. É uma chance de comer bem e fugir do fast food dos parques!"
Udmærket mad og god betjening. Al mad er dyr i Universel, men her får man i det mindste en oplevelse af at være en del af Harry Potter universet.
Gostei do restaurante, me senti comendo dentro do filme. Vem muita comida no prato. E o prato com milho com ramo é muito bom.
O restaurante é lindo. Logo que você entra encontra uma vitrine com alguns pratos que são servidos o que ajuda para quem não tem muita ideia do que vem. Os funcionários são todos uniformizados de acordo com o que vemos nos filmes e o atendimento é muito bom. A comida então é maravilhosa. Comemos bem e gastamos +- US$60 para 5 adultos e 2 crianças com as bebidas. O milho que vem no prato para 4 pessoas é uma delícia. Mesmo quem não viu os filmes se sente encantado pelo ambiente.
Se você é fã de Harry Potter não preciso nem comentar. Mas independente disso, o restaurante possui um ambiente muito agradável e uma comida muito saborosa. Recomendo o tradicional Fish & Chips britânico.
Comida boa e barata. Cenário incrível. Os funcionários se vestem a caráter. Demais! Vale muito a pena conferir. Gostei muito.
O lugar é igual ao filme, tem um sistema de auto atendimento perfeito, garçons atenciosos e bem humorados, a comida é típica, o visual todo se aproxima muito das cenas de jantar dos filmes do Harry Potter... enfim, astral nota dez! O melhor fish and chips dos parques de Orlando, aproveite!
Fuimos a desayunar, delicioso, la decoración muy buena recreando el comedor de Harry Potter, el mejor el tipico desayuno ingles, te quedas repleto, muy buena opción para empezar el día
Me gustó la comida que sirven, sobre todo las patas de pavo (estaban un poco saladas pero muy buenas de sabor) y el puré de papas. Si se quieren un poquito prueben por favor la famosa CERVEZA DE MANTEQUILLA!
"O restaurante é igualzinho ao do filme e você realmente se sente dentro de um castelo medieval, comendo comida bem rústica. O fish and chips estava melhor do que a coxa e sobrecoxa de frango que eu escolhi, pois não tinha tempero nenhum. E o milho na brasa estava muito doce, como é comum encontrar nos EUA. Para mim foi uma refeição praticamente perdida, mas valeu por estar ali, já que o ""clima"" é bem diferente. Foi uma pausa que fizemos antes de tomar uma butterbeer e continuar aproveitando o Islands of Adventure, que considero um dos melhores parques de Orlando."
Muy bueno, te brinda toda la experiencia de estar en el mundo de Harry Potter y todos los desayunos muuuy buenos. Deliciosos. Cerveza de mantequilla muy rica.
Es genial. Probas la butterbeer, no es muy ruica pero porque a mi no me gusta la cerveza, a mis amigos les gusto. Te atienden genial y parece realmente que estas dentro del mundo de Harry Potter.
Es una excelente opción para comer en el parque Islands of Adventure. Tiene varias opciones y no son caras, además que el lugar está ambientado en el mundo de Harry Potter. Muy recomendable. 
No se puede tener la experiencia completa en Harry Potter sin almorzar en las tres escobas. Un ambiente especial y cómida temática. Pidan el maiz!
Restaurante de quick service muito bom, o garçom leva os pratos até a mesa. Cerveja no ponto e o melhor fish and chips de toda a viagem.
"Siempre que visito Universal Orlando trato de almorzar en este restaurante. Está ambientado como el local ""Las Tres Escobas"" de la saga de Harry Potter y ofrece comida rápida como costillas, pollo o pescado.Se pide primero, para luego pasar a recoger la bandeja y ser ubicado en alguna mesa con ayuda del personal.Recomiendo absolutamente el maíz asado que venden, es Delicioso. Si su plato no lo incluye pueden pedirlo como adicional.Entre los bebestibles tienen algunos interesantes, y además agua con gas! Algo un tanto difícil de encontrar en Orlando."
A comida é excelente! Pedimos um prato que dava para 4 pessoas. Vinha costela, batatas, frango , mix de vegetais e milho. O prato ficou por volta de 60 dolares. Tem outras opções mais baratas também. O bom do restaurante é que mesmo cheio, as filas são rápidas, os atendentes te ajudam a encontrar uma mesa e é tudo muito limpo. Vale muito a pena experimentar esse loca, é como se vc estivesse dentro do filme.
Se na Universal, os parques do Mundo de Harry Potter faz você se sentir parte da história, este restaurante retrata perfeitamente um local dos encontros de Harry e sua turma pela perfeita similaridade com o do filme. Além disto, o cardápio é variado, boas opções, destaque para a Turkey Leg, aquela big coxa de peru acompanhada de batatas. Sempre tem uma pequena fila, mas é rápido conseguir uma mesa.
Nos encanto comer aca, hay varios menues incluidos infantiles, la clasica pata de pavo y podes adquirir Butter beer para acompañar tu comida!
Sentimos dentro do filme! Comida gostosa, lugar agradável! Vá com a família principalmente se se encanta com o mundo de Harry Potter
Muy rica la comida, si bien no hay gran variedad. La ambientación es impecable. Se complica conseguir mesa en hora pico.
O restaurante é gostoso, tem várias opções, desde comidas como bebidas, bem criativas.O mais bacana, claro, pra quem gosta do Harry, é o que acontece dentro do restaurante. Você vê sombras de bruxos andando, limpando o chão, corujas voando. A lareira recebendo cartas, enfim, o tempo todo é como se fosse uma atração.Vale a pena!
Compartir un almuerzo en uno de los lugares mas representivos de la pelicula no tiene precio, variedad de menues sabrosos con precios accesibles
El pollo rostizado, con papas al horno y con choclo realmente es una muy buena opcion. Mi mujer prefiere la opcion con ribs que tambien es muy buena. Una buena opcion para cuatro personas es la bandeja grande (para cuatro) que viene con pollo rostizado y ribs y ademas viene con ensalada, papas y 4 choclos. El costo para cuatro personas es entre 60 y 65 dolares. Repito la comida es la mejor del parque, el lugar esta realmente muy bien ambientado y se suele comer rapido. Tuvimos la suerte de comer en varias oportunidades y siempre nos fue muy grato hacerlo.
O restaurante é ótimo, dos quatro dias nos parques da Universal, almoçamos lá três vezes. Duas das quais pedimos Great Feast Platter para quatro pessoas, ótimo custo-benefício, vem uma salada de folhas, e uma bandeja enorme com quatro milhos cozidos inesquecíveis, quatro pedaços generosos de frango (coxa+sobrecoxa e peito), quatro pedaços de costela ao molho de churrasco, batatas assadas e legumes cozidos. O ambiente é ótimo, os fãs se deliciam. E o preço não é dos piores, de 15 a 20 dólares por pessoa, com este prato e bebidas. Indico.
Vale a pena comer e sentir como se estivesse no filme !!! Eles fazem um milho muito bom e eu provei o suco de abóbora ( doce e com gosto de .. Abóbora !!! 
Super re bien ambientado, para los que somos fans de Harry Potter.La comida nos parecio re normal, super comible, ja!Nada recargado.Nos re gusto
Eu e minha família adoramos o três vassouras, pela terceira vez almoçamos nesse restaurante que além de parecer que estamos no livro de aventura o menu é muito bom e farto.
Un magico pranzo di Natale...in un'ambientazione spettacolare!Ho scelto di mangiare pollo alla griglia con patate al forno e pannocchia, il tutto servito su di un grande vassoio in acciaio. Una vera bontà per il palato.....
Excelente ambientación, te sentis dentro de la película de Harry Potter. La comida también muy buena y abundante. Lo único que critico es que no venden gaseosas
O clima do local é otimo e a comida deliciosa. Destaque para o tradicional Fish and Chips! A melhor opcao é comer na varanda com a vista de todo o Parque! Muito legal!
Como fan de Harry Potter no puedo ser muy objetiva, habiendo aclarado esto..Excelente experiencia, reserve el desayuno con medianas expectativas, las superaron absolutamente la ambientación es fantástica, todas las personas que trabajan completamente insertos en sus papeles lo hace muy divertido. La comida esta muy bien, pedimos casi todos los platos del menu y todos quedaron limpios, cosa que con comensales quisquillosos en un gran logro.La atención en muy rápida pides y pagas en una caja, luego te derivan a un meson en donde te entregan tu comida, todo el proceso es bastante rápido o por lo menos los fue a las 9:00 am cuando recién abrió el parque. Absolutamente recomendable!
Restaurante com comida típica inglesa saborosa. Porém o chá e a cidra são muito doces. Os detalhes do local inspirados no filme são incríveis!
Restaurante localizado na área do Harry Potter da Island of Adventures que tenta reproduzir o descrito no famoso livro/filme. Muito gostosas e interessantes as opções de prato. Provamos a Shepherd's Pie e o Fish and Chips, que são opções individuais. Entretanto, vimos sendo entregues nas mesas grandes bandejas com uma refeição que dá para umas 4 pessoas. Experiência bacana!
Restaurante do Harry Poter.Limpinho,atendimento excelente,local muito agradável e comida maravilhosa.Recomendo para todos que são fã do Harry Poter.
Excelente. Pedimos el plato para 4, lo sirven primero con una ensalada (te dan rso y un # y te mandan a sentar) y al toque ya te dan una bandeja gigante con ribs, choclos, pollo, papas... todo eso hay que bajarlo con la butterbeer que para mi la mejor es la frozen!
O ambiente retrata o filme com maestria e os pratos também são muito bons.Já pedi o Fish and Chips e A batata recheada com sour cream e ambos foram deliciosos.Uma boa dica é escolher as mesas do fundo, que são ao ar livre pois tem uma vista linda do lago e um ângulo exclusivo para tirar fotos do castelo de Hogwarts.
...de acordo com as crianças. O imbativel custo x beneficio esta no Great Feast Platter...suficiente para 4 pessoas com um honesto frango, deliciosas batatas, uma agradável salada, vegetais para quem gosta, um milho maravilhoso e uma surpreendente costelinha de porco.
O restaurante é exatamente como no filme do Harry e a comida vale MUITO a pena além de ser MUITO barata! Universal está 100.000.000 de vezes MELHOR que os parques Disney. Vale comprar mais dias de Universal e repetir os parques US do que repetir parques Disney... Este restaurante é muito bom...Não pegamos nem fila e fomos na semana anterior ao natal.
Restaurante bem característico, para quem adora HP é sem comentários.. Tem as bebidas, tais como suco de abóbora, cerveja amanteigada; a comida é boa, o custo benefício é excelente, vc faz o pedido no caixa, peguei um pouco de fila, mas o atendimento é rápido e cordial. Dica: água de graça e não vende refrigerante na parte do HP, Hogsmeade.
Imitando o bar do povoado de Hogsmeade nos livros, também dá para experimentar as versões das bebidas que os personagens pediriam: suco de abóbora, cerveja amanteigada e afins. Bonitinho.
No pacote que compramos do hotel da Universal,recebemos um voucher de café da manhã,o lugar foi incrivelmente ambientado como no filme, para o paladar dos brasileiros o cardápio é um pouco pesado,ovos ,bacon, chouriço inglês ,mas existe opções com panquecas e frutas, gostamos e recomendamos
É um fast-food com upgrade! Pois a comida, apesar de ser pedida no caixa e retirada pouco depois no balcão, é variada e bem servida. Esse restaurante tem uma decoração muito legal, os funcionários vestidos a caráter dão um toque especial. As opções de pratos podem ser VISTAS na fila para o caixa: há uma vitrine com réplicas dos pratos! Eu comi a costela, muito bem servida, saborosa e o preço é muito bom, considerando os preços praticados em parques para refeições bastante inferiores. Ótimo custo/benefício.Não há como ir ao parque sem fazer sua refeição por la, sem dúvida a melhor opção nesse parque e, na minha opinião, uma das melhores opções entre todos os parques.
Se você é fã de Harry Potter, você TEM que comer lá. O cardápio não é muito variado, mas as opções são deliciosas e generosas. Você pode ver uma amostra dos pratos na entrada. A coxa de peru é gigante!
Se vc é fã de Harry Potter, NÃO DEIXE de conhecer esse fast food! É bem arrumadinho, então até se passa por restaurante. Comi um clássico fish & chips e aprovei
O restaurante 3 Vassouras é nota 1000....prepare o coração, leve o desentupidor de veias e encare o prato da casa, uma refeição pensada para 4 ou 5 pessoas que é um banquete digno do Hagrid. Dá pra dividir e sobra comida. São 4 espigas de milho doce, meio frango defumado, uma tira grande de costeleta de porco, legumes passados na manteiga com ervas finas e batatas em rodelas, com uma salada que antecede o prato principal que parece mais que a horta caiu em peso na sua mesa. Se sobrar espaço e tiver vontade, encare as sobremesas e depois vá na montanha russa.
Comimos el plato que tiene pollo, costillas, papas al horno y elote, muy rico y abundante. La ambientación impresionante. La butter beer deliciosa. SIn duda una excelente opción en IOA.We ate the platter with chicken, ribs, potatoes and corn, it was tasty and abundant. The decoration is amazing. The butter beer is delicious. It is a great option in IOA
Fuimos con mi novia al mediodía visitando la atracción de Harry Potter en Universal Studios. Tengo que admitir que tenía mis dudas al principio, pero realmente la comida fue excelente y a pesar de que la cola para ordenar era un poco larga, va avanzando rápido. Las ribs con acompañamiento de choclo es para recomendar. El lugar es maravilloso, especialmente para aquellos que hayan visto las peliculas de Harry Potter.
Para quem é fã, poder almoçar em um dos estabelecimentos que tanto aparece no livro é demais.Nós escolhemos nossa comida, que estava maravilhosa, e para beber, a famosa cerveja amanteigada (que apesar de mega doce, é gostosa). O ambiente, a roupa dos garçons, tudo é demais, e faz com que você se sinta mesmo em Hogsmeade.
Totalmente recomendable para los fanáticos de Harry Potter. Pidan el Maíz Asado, es lo mejor que tienen.La comida en general son costillas, pollo asado y pescado frito, todo acompañado de papas (fritas o salteadas). Para beber sólo cuentan con líquidos como té helado, limonada, agua con gas y de ese tipo. No tienen bebidas gaseosas de las típicas, así que háganse la idea de pedir otra alternativa.
So para divertir se mesmo,comidinha meio artificial,na hora da fone e ou fantasia vai que vai,mas é melhor não esperar o melhor.Razoável para um restaurante temático e divertido.
Pedimos la pata de pavo ahumada y las ribs, que venian acompañados con choclo hervido y papas fritas condimentadas con algo apenas picante. Tomamos la cerveza de manteca (la recomendamos frozen) Todo delicioso. Lo único malo fue que había espera para tomar mesa, pero nos sentamos con otra pareja y compartimos lugar
Il était exclu que je passe par ce par sans manger ici. Soyons clairs, c'est de la bouffe de parc d'attraction, des choses très simples et assez chères. Mais le décor et l'ambiance sauront séduire chaque fan hardcore qui rentrera ici. Il ne manque que Madame Rosmerta et tout était parfait !
o restaurante é massa, bem caracterizado como o do filme, nele você pode pedir a famosa turkey leg, e também algumas outras opções com acompanhamentos tipo milho... para beber tem as duas opçoes de cerveja amanteigada, eu particularmente indico a frozen, e limonada, NÃO te refrigerante, e para sobremesa tem uma torta de maça deliciosa!
Si se es fan es necesario conocerlo. La experiencia supera la comida, pero ahora queda como segundo en la lista tras la apertura de The Leaky Cauldron en Diagon Alley. Tratando de opinar objetivamente, la comida no me pareció nada del otro mundo. Exageradamente abundante, tuvimos que dejar la mitad del plato, ya que para nosotros era imposible consumir medio pollo o las empalagosas piernas de pavo por persona .
Comida básica, porém as batatas parecem ser diferentes, não aquelas congeladas que só fritam e pronto... Pedi Fish and Chips com Limonada muito boa. A esta é boa acompanhada com alimentos, pois sozinha se torna muito enjoativa. O lugar é igualzinho ao do filme, e para os fãs de Harry Potter é tudo muito encantador, adorei o lugar!
Pedimos Fish and Chips e Limonada. A comida estava muito boa, mas a porção não era tão bem servida como outras opções em Orlando. A limonada estava uma delícia. Legal para quem é fã do Harry Potter, como nós, pois nos sentimos no cenário do filme e o copo é personalizado.
Quando olhei o cardápio pela internet não fiquei muito apetecida e pensei que me daria mal nesse restaurante. Fui de fish and chips e foi a melhor refeição que eu fiz em tempos,estava MARAVILHOSO. O ambiente é muito bem decorado e a butterbeer é nada mais que sorvete de caramelo no estilo raspadinha, aconselho a pedir a versão frozen(que vem com pedaços de gelo no estilo raspadinha mesmo) e na caneca, pra trazer de recordação, trouxe a minha e só bebo nela aqui em casa.
A comida não é maravilhosa mas é razoável... o restaurante tematizado é um plus na já tão boa área temática do Harry Potter.
gostei muito do ambiente do restaurante, muito bonito e fiel aos detalhes do filme, quanto a comida acabei pedindo menu infantil e por isso nao aproveitei tanto... deveria ter pedido outro prato... rsrsrsrsr...
Vale o ambiente. Muito legal. A butterbeer é doce e enjoativa, mas para os fans de HP é obrigatório provar.
O que vale a pena é poder comer no ambiente de um pub do filme do Harry Potter. A comida é ok, nada d+.Possui a cerveja amanteigada sem álcool, mas não provamos, achamos caro.
Я не понимаю народ, который ругается на кухню. Да, сам выбор блюд прост, но он на голову выше большинства фаст фуда в том же Юниверсал. Так что, если вы голодны, то все равно найдете что поесть. А ходить сюда нужно между обедом, когда народа поменьше и просто посидеть с кружкой пива. Вы получите огромное наслаждение.
Nosso sonho de ir ao Islands of Adventure era entrar no mundo do Harry Potter. Se esse é o clima da sua família também, fazer uma refeição nesse restaurante é obrigatório. Fui informada no setor de reservas de restaurantes que por ser restaurante de balcão, eles não aceitam reservas. Fomos cedo para evitar filas porque por lá isso é o que não falta. Foi ótimo porque mais tarde já havia uma fila bem grande. A comida é excelente se você pensar nas comidas dos outros restaurantes de balcão dos parques, e não é cara. Você escolhe, pede e paga. Pega sua comida em outro balcão e se dirige às mesas. Se você pagar no cartão, vão te dar uma pena gigante para assinar (como as que os bruxos usam no filme). Foto imperdível! Prepare a máquina! Aliás, o lugar é lindo, por dentro e por fora, e rende lindas fotos. Adorei! Vamos novamente!!! Já ia me esquecendo... Tem cerveja amanteigada e é uma delícia! Você pode levar a caneca para casa.
Restaurante de Comidas e não só lanches, delicioso, e para quem tem grande apetite uma boa pedida por as porções são enormes, carnes, costelas, frangos e outras coisas deliciosas.
De lo mejor que puedes encontrar en un parque de diversiones, la nieve de fresa con mantequilla de maní es deliciosa.
Não se assuste se ao entrar nesses restaurante verificar que todas as mesas desocupadas estão reservadas. Uma dessas reservas é sua!Um atendente perguntará quantas pessoas são, você se dirigirá ao caixa para escolher o que vai comer e beber. Paga e depois vai para o balcão esperar para pegar a bandeja com o seu prato.Segue para a mesa, que será indicada por um dos atendentes, o qual retirará a plaquinha de reservada.Aqui tem a famosa Turkey Leg, salada e um delicioso bolo de batata com carne moída, tempero que faz lembrar a comida da vovó.O ambiente é muito agradável e você almoça observando os detalhes da decoração, sentindo que faz parte do filme do Harry Potter.
Son lo mejor de la casa, es una comida muy aceptable para un parque de diversiones. una excelente opcion para comer buena comida, en un lindo restaurante tematico, el servicio es agilisimo, casi magico, bueno esta en Hogsmeade. No duden en ir, les aseguro que les va a encantar
o serviço é semelhante a um pub inglês. vc paga e segue para a mesa. Os pratos são bem servidos, alimenta um facilmente, Existe um prato para 4 pessoas, mais econômico. A bebida é que não tem refrigerante, só cerveja de manteiga e sucos, peça o de pumpkim ou uma simples limonada. Vale a pena almoçar lá e para ter gás para encarar a tarde no parque. Aproveite para tirar fotos a decoração é bem legal para os amantes da saga de Harry Potter.
"Além o ambiente encantador para qualquer fã de Harry Potter (com detalhes como assinar a conta com caneta de pena!), a comida é ótima. Escolhemos um prato chamado ""Great Feast"", que teoricamente é para quatro pessoas, mas na realidade serviria mais (vem muita comida, incluindo salada, diferentes tipos de legumes, frango, costelinha defumada). E cerveja amanteigada não pode faltar!"
fica dentro do cenario do Harry Potter. o prato serve 4 pessoas muito bem e sai super em conta, menos de 10 dolares por pessoa.a comida é saborosa e dentro dos parques da Disney foi a que mais nos agradou tanto pelo preco como pelo sabor. foi o dia em que realmente almocamos com prazer.
Muito lindo, ambientação bacana, comida rápida e bem gostosa, preços razoáveis para o local. Gostei e recomendo. Em tempo: pedimos o fish and chips. Estava ótimo.
"O The Three Broomsticks (Tês Vassouras) do Parque Universal foi feito pelos mesmos cenógrafos dos filmes e foi criado antes da aparição do restaurante nas telonas, ou seja, o que aparece no filme é ""cópia"" do restaurante do parque.Para os fãs de Harry Potter é parada obrigatória, assim como o Hog's Head, nem tanto para comer mas para se ambientar no mundo da magia."
"Este restaurante fica na área do Harry Potter. Tomei café da manha lá. O local tem cenografia atraente e muito ligada ao tema. A comida é apenas razoável e o preço é alto. Garçonetes ""auxiliam"" os clientes a sentar nas mesas e a desocupá-las (um pouco ríspidas para um parque de crianças)."
Além da comida me surpreender positivamente, a decoração é um ponto forte neste restaurante. O atendimento é excelente! Você sente como se estivesse realmente no filme do Harry Potter! Muito bom, voltaria com certeza!
Nous sommes allés luncher à ce resto situé dans la section Harry Potter au parc d'attraction Universal Island of adventure. Le fait d'avoir recréé le village et la taverne de façon fidèle aux films est vraiment génial et plaira sûrement au fans d'Harry Potter. Les choix de repas rapides sont limités, mais les fish & chip sont bons. Les prix moyens et la bière au beurre (lait frappé au caramel) est bonne mais très sucrée.
Me pareció regular...igual que cualquier otro...nada especial...La ambientación es buena, pero el sistema de pedidos bastante lento. La comida rica pero sin muchas opciones para elegir. Platos abundante para compartir y precios accesibles.
A decoração do local é fantástica. Retrata bem o filme. Minha filha que é vidrada nos filmes do Harry Potter adorou todos os detalhes usados para decorar o ambiente. O único porém em relação ao ambiente, é que a distância entre as mesas é muito pequena. Faz o ambiente ficar um pouc apertado. A comida, achei um pouco fraca tanto para mim quanto para a minha filha menor que não comeu quase nada. Mas mesmo assim vale por fazer você se sentir dentro do filme.
Refeição muito boa, mas o forte mesmo desse restaurante é a ambientação do lugar. Você se sente realmente como se estivesse almoçando em uma locação da série Harry Potter; e claro, não deixe de provar a cerveja amanteigada, vale a pena matar a curiosidade, não tem nada de muito diferente, mas é muito bem elaborada e refrescante!
Este é sem dúvida o lugar para almoçar quando estiveres no mundo de Harry Potter! Comida boa em um ambiente que os fãs de JKH não ficarão desapontados. Não esqueça de pedir uma Cerveja amanteigada e um suco de abóbora para acompanhar!
Idêntico aos relatos dos livros e aos filmes esse restaurante oferece comidas bem diferentes do usual brasileiro. Mas vale a pena experimentar
A caracterização de um dos principais estabelecimentos da franquia Harry Potter, o restaurante Three Broomsticks/Três Vassouras tem um cardápio variado que procura emular o local descrito no livro, mas acaba abraçando também a conveniência de ser praticamente um fast food para atender eficientemente o público visitante. Pratos de carne, peixe, frango, entre outros são escolhidos no caixa, pagos (os preços são razoáveis) e então é dada uma senha e um atendente chama pelo número com a bandeja. O ambiente em si é bem decorado, com madeira prevalecendo sobre outros elementos. Vale a visita.
Talvez para os mega fãs de Harry potter, como eu, vão amar o ambiente. Sensacional entrar no restaurante como se fosse mais um personagem do filme. Mas não curti a comida. Pedi a cerveja amenteigada, que o gosto é péssimo. O Suco de abobora então, mas pedimos e guardamos de souvenir todas as embalagens!A decoração do restaurante é incrível e fascinante, idêntica a do filme. A comida não curti, não sei se pedi errado, mas enfim...Apenas uma vez para conhecer, não volto...
Foi o melhor restaurante existente nos parques temáticos. Qualidade e preço excelentes.Não deixe de experimentar a costela assada que vem acompanhada de um delicioso milho caramelado.
Está mejor que cualquiera de los otros lugares de comida. Tienen un paquete para 4 personas que contiene 4 elotes riquísimos, 4 piernas de pavo, 4 cotillitas y suficiente ensalada (no te acabas todo) Además tienen la cerveza de mantequilla de 3 sabores. Está económico en comparación con los precios de otros lugares. No tienes que hacer reservación, es muy grande y te pasan conforme vas llegando 
Debo iniciar diciendo que lo buno que es este lugar se multiplica por 10 si eres fanatico de las peliculas de harry potter .Esta ubicado en Universal Estudios , en la isla de la aventura ambientado como el restaurante en que comen harry y sus compañeros en la película ,el lugar y la vestimenta de los empleados .El concepto es como un restaurante de comida rápida ya que ordenas en la caja y te entregan el pedido en una bandeja , y luego te diriges a la mesa , los empleados distribuyen las mesas según el numero de comensales y están pendientes de que ayudarte y que no hayan mas comensales que asientos , la comida es buena y a un precio adecuado , pollo asado , costilla a la barbacoa , elote asado y sin faltar la cerveza de Mantequilla que puedes pedir por unos dólares mas en un tazón de souvenir muy bonito . En temporada alta se llena mucho , y hay largas colas fuera del restaurante , no se si aceptan reservas ,sin embargo yo estuve en temporada alta y e funciono comer antes de las 11:30 am ya que se llena de 12:00 del medio día a 3:00 pm , así que llega antes o después . La comida es abundante , nada fuera de serie , hay parrilladas familiares que ahorras mas , pero si tienes hijos adolescentes y amantes de las películas o libros de Harry Potter , este es un destino Obligado. No te arrepentirás al ver a tus hijos felices . Lo disfrutamos mucho.
"Ho fatto il pacchetto che prevedeva la colazione qui. Fantastico: succo di zucca, pancake, brioches, uova, di tutto insomma. Ringrazio di non soffrire le giostre se no dopo una colazione simile (non è proprio leggera) sarei stata sicuro male. Se non l'avete ""offerta"" è abbastanza cara però il locale è bello. Sembra proprio di essere all'interno del film. Adiacente c'è anche la Testa di porco."
El servicio muy lento, pese a ir en temporada baja. La comida en general poco sabrosa. Algunas bebidas realmente vomitivas, en especial la Butterbeer y el jugo de calabaza.
Die Menschen, die hier arbeiten sind sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Obwohl es sehr voll war, haben wir in Ruhe essen können und es hat uns auch gut geschmeckt. 
"Este es el restaurant que está en el pueblo de Harry Potter en ""Islands of Adventure"". Es un lugar muy cálido, con una atmósfera estilo inglés antíguo, todo de madera imitando una ""taberna"". Me gustó mucho la experiencia, la comida es muy buena y abundante con pollo, carne, pavo, todo a la leña acompañado con maíz, vegetales en grandes bandejas estilo medieval. El ambiente en la barra es estupendo y todo el personal viste de época. Muy conveniente, ya que está en la mitad del camino y te sirve para hacer el ""break"" del mediodía y luego seguir. Tienen la famosa ""cerveza de mantequilla"" para los niños. El precio está muy acorde a tu disfrute. Lo recomiendo."
Você ao comer lá se sente em Hogwarts! Comida saborosa, inglesa, e o melhor, acompanhada de suco de abóbora ou cerveja amanteigada. Pedimos um The Great Feast, comemos em quatro e...sobrou! E assinar o recibo do cartão de credito com uma pena, não tem preço!
"Wir haben in den ""drei Besen"" gefrühstückt (nachdem wir um 6h aufgestanden waren, um früh im Harry Potter Park zu sein).Wir hatten das Früchtefrühstück (frisches Obst sehr gut) und das Pancake Frühstück. Die Pancakes waren sehr lecker. Die Croissants dagegen nicht sehr gut. Auch der Kaffee war sehr amerikanisch.....Das ""gut"" hat sich das Restaurant doch verdient - wenn man bedenkt, dass es in einem Themepark ist und Millonen an Menschen durchlaufen. Sauberkeit war auch ok. Und vor allem zählt das Erlebnis - so muss man es wohl sehen..."
Este restaurante ubicado en la zona de Harry Potter, no fué lo que esperaba. Cuando ingresamos a pedir el menu la cajera no sabia español y no tenia la menor predisposicion por intentar entendernos y ofrecernos la comida que venden o alguien que nos pueda guiar. El lugar no es muy limpio, nos sirvieron un menu para 5 con ensaladas, choclos, pollo y ribs, que no estaba mal pero no terminaba de convencer.-Habia unas animaciones que se veian en la planta superior con personajes de la pelicula que si no te dabas cuenta pasaban desapercibidas. No habia Coca Cola, no tenian, solo bebida tipo jugo. o unico bueno es la ambientacion y la cercania al sector de Harry Potter, nada mas.-saludos
